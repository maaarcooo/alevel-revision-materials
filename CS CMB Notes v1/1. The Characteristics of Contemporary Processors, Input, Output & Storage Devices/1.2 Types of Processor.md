# 1.2 Types of Processor

## RISC vs CISC

### RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)

**Characteristics:**
- **Small instruction set** with simple instructions
- Each instruction takes **one clock cycle** to execute
- **Suitable for pipelining** due to consistent instruction timing
- Compilers are more complicated and generate more instructions
- **Fewer addressing modes**
- **Fewer general purpose registers**
- **Fewer transistors**

**Usage:**
- Smartphones and tablets

**Advantages:**
- Requires less power
- Costs less to manufacture
- Efficient pipelining

**Disadvantages:**
- Takes up more space in memory (more instructions needed)
- More complex compilers required

**Example:** Multiplying two numbers X and Y
```
LDA R1, X
LDA R2, Y
MULT R1, R2
STO R1, X
```

### CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)

**Characteristics:**
- **Large instruction set** with complex instructions
- Instructions can take **multiple clock cycles** to execute
- **More general purpose registers**
- **More addressing modes**
- **More transistors**
- Instructions built into hardware

**Usage:**
- Laptops and desktop computers
- Microcontrollers and embedded systems

**Advantages:**
- Instructions take less space in memory
- Compilers are less complicated
- Can accomplish tasks in fewer lines of code

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires more power
- Costs more to manufacture
- Not suited to pipelining
- Many specialised instructions created but only a few are used

**Example:** Same multiplication operation
```
MULT A, B
```

### RISC vs CISC Comparison

| Feature | RISC | CISC |
|---------|------|------|
| **Instruction Set** | Small, simple | Large, complex |
| **Clock Cycles** | One per instruction | Multiple per instruction |
| **Transistors** | Fewer | More |
| **Pipelining** | Suited | Not suited |
| **Compilers** | More complicated | Less complicated |
| **Registers** | Fewer general purpose | More general purpose |
| **Addressing Modes** | Fewer | More |
| **Memory Usage** | Takes more space | Takes less space |
| **Power Consumption** | Less | More |
| **Manufacturing Cost** | Less | More |
| **Typical Usage** | Smartphones, tablets | Laptops, desktops |

**Important Notes:**
- Programs written for RISC processors **won't work on CISC** processors and vice versa
- Programs written for one RISC processor **won't necessarily work on another RISC** processor (different instruction sets)

## Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

### What is a GPU?

A GPU processes graphics within the computer to **reduce the load on the CPU**. While CPUs are general purpose processors, GPUs are **designed specifically for graphics**.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Contains **hundreds or thousands of smaller processing cores**
- Can perform an instruction on **multiple pieces of data at one time**
- Built-in circuitry/instructions for common graphics operations
- Can be **part of the graphics card** or **embedded in the CPU**
- Performs operations **in parallel**

### GPU Uses Beyond Graphics

**3D Modelling:**
- Rendering lighting effects, textures and shadows

**Data Modelling:**
- Handling large datasets
- Complex operations like sorting and filtering data

**Financial Modelling:**
- Simulating scenarios in risk modelling and option pricing
- Running multiple simulations in parallel

**Data Mining:**
- Analysing large amounts of data to find patterns
- Sorting, searching, pattern recognition, statistical analysis

**Complex Numerical Calculations:**
- Matrix multiplication and inversion (performed in parallel)
- Numerical simulations for physics and engineering
- Solving differential equations

**Machine Learning:**
- Training computers on massive amounts of data
- Matrix multiplications and computations in parallel
- Making predictions on new data

**Calculations on Multiple Data:**
- Insurance pricing, modelling risk, calculating bills
- Any scenario requiring simultaneous calculations on multiple data points

### GPU Suitability

GPUs are suited for tasks that utilise:

**Specialist Instructions:**
- Operations on matrices, vectors and geometric transformations
- Capabilities expanded and generalised for wider range of complex calculations

**Multiple Cores:**
- CPU cores optimised for **serial processing**
- GPU cores optimised for **parallel processing**
- Can perform many calculations simultaneously
- Ideal for tasks broken down into smaller parts

**SIMD Processing:**
- **Single Instruction Multiple Data** processing
- Multiple processing elements perform same operation on multiple data points simultaneously
- Common in image processing, simulations and machine learning

### Benefits of Using a GPU

**Parallel Processing:**
- Can handle many tasks simultaneously as multicore processors

**Speed:**
- Parallel processing speeds up tasks, particularly with large amounts of data or complex computations

**Efficiency:**
- More calculations per unit of power consumed compared to CPUs
- More energy efficient for parallel tasks

**Note:** It's not possible to only use a GPU; the CPU assigns tasks to the GPU.

## Multicore & Parallel Processors

### Parallel Processing

**Definition:** When a computer has **multiple cores** that can work together.

**Functionality:**
- Each core can work on the **same task** to complete it more quickly
- Each core can work on **separate tasks** at the same time

### Multicore Processing

**Definition:** A system with **more than one processing unit** in a single processor that can **independently process instructions at the same time**.

**Note:** Parallel processing can also be achieved by utilising more than one processor (e.g., a CPU and a GPU).

### Benefits and Limitations

| **Benefits** | **Limitations** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Speed:** Total execution time reduced if tasks can be divided into simultaneous subtasks | **Limit on maximum speed:** Even with infinite processors, there's a limit if parts of the program can't be parallelised |
| **Improved performance:** Simultaneous computation on different data subsets (machine learning, data mining, scientific computing) | **Complex programming:** Harder to write code than serial processing; tasks must be synchronised and data shared correctly |
| **Better resource utilisation:** Multi-core/multiple processors used more effectively | **Debugging difficulty:** More difficult than serial programs due to precise timing of specific events |
| **Problem solving:** Large and complex problems solved more easily | **Communication overhead:** Communication between processors takes significant time and resources, potentially outweighing benefits |
| **Real-time applications:** Graphics rendering and real-time applications more feasible | **Limited applicability:** Not all tasks can be run in parallel; some must be executed serially |

### Benefits of Multicore Processors

**Multitasking:**
- Each core can work on a different task
- Particularly effective with multiple applications open simultaneously

**Background Tasks:**
- Background tasks (e.g., anti-malware scans) assigned to one core
- Reduces impact on other tasks
- Single core processors experience slowdowns from background tasks

**Improved Responsiveness:**
- If one program becomes unresponsive, it won't slow down the computer as much
- Other cores continue running their tasks
