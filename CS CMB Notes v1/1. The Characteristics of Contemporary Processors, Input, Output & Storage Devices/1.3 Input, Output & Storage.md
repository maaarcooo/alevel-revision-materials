# 1.3 Input, Output & Storage - Revision Notes

## Input & Output Devices

### Input Devices
**Input devices** are hardware components that allow users to interact with a computer system by inputting data or commands.

**Common Examples:**
- **Keyboard** - Input text and commands
- **Mouse** - Navigate screen and select items
- **Touchscreen** - Direct touch interaction with display
- **Microphone** - Capture audio input for voice commands/recording
- **Webcam** - Capture video input
- **Scanner** - Digitise physical documents/images
- **Game Controller** - Control game characters and interactions
- **Graphics Tablet** - Draw directly onto computer for design work
- **Biometric Devices** - Fingerprint scanners, facial recognition for security
- **Barcode Reader** - Scan barcodes for retail/inventory
- **Joystick** - Fluid movement control for games/simulators
- **Magnetic Stripe Reader** - Read data from cards (credit/debit cards)

### Output Devices
**Output devices** receive information from a computer system and present it to the user in comprehensible form.

**Common Examples:**
- **Monitor** - Display visual output (text, images, videos)
- **Printer** - Produce hard copy of digital documents (inkjet, laser, 3D)
- **Speakers** - Output audio (music, sound effects, voice)
- **Headphones** - Personal audio output
- **Projector** - Project display onto large screen/wall
- **Braille Display** - Output information in Braille for visually impaired
- **Plotter** - Print large, high-quality diagrams (engineering/architecture)
- **VR Headset** - Immersive visual and audio output
- **Computer-Controlled Machinery** - Output commands to machinery in manufacturing/robotics

**Note:** Some devices are both input and output (e.g., touchscreens).

### Choosing the Right Device

Consider these factors when selecting devices:

1. **User Needs** - What tasks will be performed? (e.g., graphic designer needs graphics tablet)
2. **User Skills** - Comfort level with device (touchscreen vs mouse/keyboard)
3. **Environment** - Where will it be used? (wireless vs wired, portability needs)
4. **Cost** - Budget constraints vs required features
5. **Speed & Accuracy** - Data transfer rates and recording detail
6. **Relevance** - Is this the appropriate device for the task?

## Secondary Storage Devices

### 1. Magnetic Storage

**How it works:** Binary information represented by two magnetic states - **polarised** (aligned poles) and **unpolarised** (random poles). These states represent 1 and 0.

#### Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
- **Capacity:** 500GB - 5TB (typical consumer-grade)
- **Structure:** Rotating magnetic platters with read/write head on actuating arm
- **Benefits:**
  - High storage capacity
  - Relatively low cost per GB
  - Suitable for long-term storage and backup
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Slower read/write speeds compared to flash
  - Susceptible to physical damage from movement
  - Moving parts can wear out over time

#### Magnetic Tape
- Historical storage medium (1950s-1980s)
- Long stretches wound onto reels
- Bulky but improved with diagonal writing
- Superseded by modern technology

#### Floppy Disks
- Thin magnetic disk in protective plastic casing
- Capacity: ~1MB (up to 200MB in later versions)
- Highly portable
- Replaced by USB flash drives

### 2. Optical Storage

**How it works:** Lasers read data from disc surface. **Pits** (recessed portions) scatter light, **lands** (flat portions) reflect light. Pits = 0, Lands = 1. Data stored in spiral tracks.

#### CDs (Compact Discs)
- **Capacity:** 700MB
- **Uses:** Audio files, text, digital images
- **Benefits:**
  - Small, thin, lightweight (very portable)
  - Durable and relatively immune to environmental conditions
  - Easy to transport
  - Low cost per disc
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Limited storage capacity
  - Relatively slow read/write speeds
  - Easily damaged by scratches
- **Varieties:** CD-R (write once), CD-RW (rewritable), CD-ROM (read-only)

#### DVDs (Digital Versatile/Video Disc)
- **Capacity:** 4.7GB - 9GB
- Higher storage than CDs
- Suited for digital videos

#### Blu-Ray Discs
- **Capacity:** 25GB - 50GB
- Over 5× DVD capacity
- Used for high-resolution films

### 3. Flash Storage

**How it works:** Silicon semiconductors forming **NAND** and **NOR** logic gates store electrical charge in two states (high/low), representing binary values. Data organised in **blocks** combined into **pages**.

- **NOR gates:** Preferred for small quantities of data (executable code)
- **NAND gates:** Preferred for larger files (photos, videos)

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Non-volatile** - Retains data when power lost
- **Fast** data access
- **Compact** size
- Can be electronically erased and reprogrammed
- **Expensive** per gigabyte compared to magnetic/optical

#### Solid State Drives (SSD)
- **Capacity:** 120GB - 4TB (typical consumer-grade)
- **Benefits:**
  - Fast read/write speeds
  - No moving parts (more resistant to damage)
  - Light and portable
  - Silent operation
  - High durability
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Higher cost per GB
  - Limited lifespan (voltage required to write increases with each write cycle until page becomes unusable)

#### USB Flash Drives
- **Capacity:** 8GB - 256GB (common sizes)
- Very portable (small and lightweight)
- Moderate durability
- Moderate cost per GB

## Comparison of Storage Types

| Storage Type | Description | Benefits | Drawbacks |
|--------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Magnetic** (HDD) | Magnetising particles on disk | High capacity, low cost per GB, long-term storage | Slower speeds, physical damage risk, moving parts wear |
| **Optical** (CD/DVD/Blu-ray) | Laser burns pits into disc surface | Durable, portable, suitable for distribution | Lower capacity, slower speeds, easily scratched |
| **Flash** (SSD/USB) | Store data in flash memory cells | Fast speeds, no moving parts, silent | Higher cost per GB, limited write cycles |

## Choosing the Right Storage Device

Consider these factors:

1. **Storage Needs** - How much data? (Large data = HDD, small data = USB)
2. **Performance Needs** - Fast access required? (Video editing/gaming = SSD)
3. **Portability** - Need to transport data? (USB drives, external SSD/HDD)
4. **Cost** - Budget constraints vs capacity/performance needs

## RAM and ROM

### RAM (Random Access Memory)

**Purpose:** Fast main memory storing data and programs currently being used by the computer.

**Characteristics:**
- **Volatile** - Loses contents when power is lost
- Very fast access speeds (faster than flash memory)
- **Read and write** capability
- Directly accessible (processor can access any part equally fast)
- Temporary storage while computer running

**Typical Capacity:** 4GB - 8GB (more expensive per GB than secondary storage)

**Role:** The more RAM a system has, the more data it can process simultaneously, leading to faster performance.

### ROM (Read-Only Memory)

**Purpose:** Stores BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or firmware for computer startup and hardware initialisation.

**Characteristics:**
- **Non-volatile** - Retains contents when power is lost
- **Read-only** - Cannot be modified once programmed
- Stores fixed instruction sequences (e.g., bootstrap routine)
- Essential for system startup

**Key Difference:** RAM is volatile and used for temporary storage during operation; ROM is non-volatile and stores permanent startup instructions.

## Virtual Storage (Cloud Storage)

**Definition:** Storing information remotely so it can be accessed by any computer with access to the same system (typically over the Internet).

**How it works:**
1. Data transmitted over Internet to data centre
2. Data stored on servers maintained by cloud storage provider
3. Data can be accessed and retrieved as needed
4. Often an abstraction of multiple drives (100s of HDDs/SSDs) acting as single storage

**Examples:** Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Apple iCloud, networked storage in offices/schools

### Benefits
- **Scalability** - Easy to increase storage capacity as needs grow
- **Accessibility** - Data accessible from anywhere with Internet connection
- **Data Protection** - Data redundancy protects against hardware failure
- **Cost-Effective** - Pay only for storage used, no infrastructure maintenance
- **Convenience** - Files available "in the cloud" on any connected device

### Drawbacks
- **Dependence on Internet** - Access slow/impossible with poor connection
- **Security Concerns** - Storing sensitive data off-site poses risks despite security measures
- **Ongoing Costs** - Ongoing expense that adds up over time
- **Network Speed Limitations** - Limited by user's network speed

**Important:** Do not confuse virtual storage with virtual memory. Virtual storage = data stored on the cloud. Virtual memory = using secondary storage as RAM when RAM is full.
