# 2.1 Systems Software - Revision Notes

## Operating Systems

**Definition**: A collection of programs that manage computer hardware and software resources, providing an interface between the user and computer.

### Key Functions:
- **Memory Management** - Paging, segmentation, virtual memory
- **Resource Management** - Scheduling CPU time between processes
- **File Management** - Creating, moving, editing, deleting files and folders
- **Input/Output Management** - Device drivers
- **Interrupt Management** - Handling interrupt signals
- **Utility Software** - Disk defragmenter, backup, formatting
- **Security** - Firewall protection
- **User Interface** - GUI or CLI

## Memory Management

Memory must be shared efficiently between multiple programs. The OS uses three main techniques:

### Paging
- Memory divided into **equal-sized blocks** called pages
- Programs split into pages of the same size
- Pages swapped between main memory and hard disk as needed
- **Drawback**: Can cause **internal fragmentation** (unused space within pages)

### Segmentation
- Memory divided into **variable-sized blocks** called segments
- Segments represent logical divisions (e.g., functions, loops, conditional statements)
- More efficient use of memory space
- **Drawback**: Can cause **external fragmentation** (gaps between segments)

### Virtual Memory
- Uses a section of the **hard disk as an extension of RAM**
- Pages not currently in use are moved to virtual memory
- Allows more programs to run simultaneously
- **Drawback**: **Disk thrashing** - system freezes when pages are swapped too frequently between RAM and hard disk

## Interrupts

**Definition**: Signals from software or hardware indicating that a process requires immediate attention from the processor.

### Types of Interrupts:
- **Hardware interrupts** - Generated by external devices (keyboard, mouse, printer)
- **Software interrupts** - Triggered by programs or OS (file requests, errors)
- **Trap interrupts** - Intentionally triggered for debugging or error handling

### Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) Process:

1. **Interrupt Request (IRQ)** - Device/software generates interrupt signal
2. **Interrupt Acknowledge** - Interrupt handler checks priority
3. **Save State** - Current register contents saved to stack
4. **ISR Lookup** - Appropriate ISR fetched from memory
5. **ISR Execution** - Interrupt handled by running the ISR
6. **Restore State** - Original register contents restored from stack
7. **Resume** - Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle continues

**Priority**: Interrupts stored in order of priority in an **interrupt register**. Higher priority interrupts can interrupt lower priority processes.

## Scheduling

The OS allocates processor time fairly between jobs using scheduling algorithms.

### Pre-emptive Algorithms
Jobs can be actively started and stopped by the OS.

#### 1. Round Robin
- Each job given equal **time slice** (time quantum)
- Jobs cycled through until completion
- **Advantage**: Fair allocation
- **Disadvantage**: Long jobs take extended time; doesn't consider priority

#### 2. Multilevel Feedback Queues
- Multiple queues with different priorities
- Jobs move between queues based on behaviour
- Shorter/critical tasks prioritised
- **Advantage**: Efficient for varying job types
- **Disadvantage**: Complex to implement

#### 3. Shortest Remaining Time
- Jobs ordered by time left for completion
- Shortest remaining time executed first
- **Advantage**: Minimises waiting time for short jobs
- **Disadvantage**: Risk of processor starvation for longer jobs

### Non Pre-emptive Algorithms
Once started, jobs run until completion.

#### 4. First Come First Served (FCFS)
- Jobs processed in chronological order
- **Advantage**: Simple to implement
- **Disadvantage**: No priority consideration; long jobs block shorter ones

#### 5. Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest jobs executed first
- **Advantage**: Minimises average waiting time
- **Disadvantage**: Requires knowing job duration; processor starvation for long jobs

## Types of Operating Systems

### Distributed
- Runs across **multiple devices**
- Load spread across multiple processors
- Used in supercomputing and cloud systems

### Embedded
- Designed for **specific devices** (washing machines, microwaves, car systems)
- Limited functionality, hard to update
- **Low power consumption**

### Multi-tasking
- Allows multiple tasks to run **seemingly simultaneously**
- Uses **time slicing** to switch rapidly between programs
- Standard for modern desktop/mobile OS

### Multi-user
- Multiple users share one computer (typically a supercomputer)
- Scheduling algorithm ensures fair processor time
- Risk of processor starvation without proper scheduling

### Real-Time
- Guarantees task completion within **specific time frame**
- Critical for time-sensitive applications (self-driving cars, nuclear power stations, medical equipment)
- **Safety-critical** systems

## BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)

**First program** run when computer starts.

### Functions:
- **POST (Power-On Self-Test)** - Checks hardware (keyboard, disk drives) are connected and functional
- **CPU Clock Check** - Verifies CPU, memory, and processor operational
- **External Device Check** - Tests for connected external memory devices
- **Bootstrap Loader** - Loads operating system from hard disk into RAM

Stored on a small memory chip on the motherboard. Without functional BIOS, the OS cannot be loaded.

---

## Device Drivers

**Definition**: Programs that enable the OS to communicate with hardware devices.

### Purpose:
- Translate between OS and hardware (printers, graphics cards, network cards)
- Bridge between major OS and hardware embedded systems
- Enable specific operations (e.g., printer driver allows print commands)

### Characteristics:
- **Device-specific** - Different drivers for different hardware
- **OS-specific** - Must match the operating system
- Provided by hardware manufacturers

---

## Virtual Machines

**Definition**: Software implementation of a computer system that mimics hardware functionality.

### Uses:

#### 1. Executing Intermediate Code
- **Intermediate code** - Halfway between machine code and source code
- Platform-independent (runs on any OS/hardware)
- Virtual machine provides translation environment
- Example: Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runs Java bytecode

#### 2. Running OS Within Another
- Test programs on different operating systems without multiple devices
- Create isolated development environments
- Protection from malware (affects VM, not host)
- Run incompatible software (e.g., old OS versions, games consoles on PC)

### Advantages:
- Saves time and money (no need for multiple physical devices)
- Safe testing environment
- Easy to reset or rollback

### Disadvantages:
- **Slower performance** than native execution
- Shares system resources (CPU, RAM, storage) with host OS
- Can be complex to configure
