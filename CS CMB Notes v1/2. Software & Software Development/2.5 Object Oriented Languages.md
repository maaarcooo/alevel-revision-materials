# 2.5 Object Oriented Languages - Revision Notes

## 1. Classes

A **class** is a blueprint or template used to create objects in Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

**Key Points:**
- Defines the structure and behaviour that objects will have
- Contains **attributes** (variables) and **methods** (functions/procedures)
- Enables reusable, organised, and modular code
- **Instantiation** is the process of creating an object from a class

**Types of Classes:**
| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Built-in/Prebuilt | Already exist in programming languages | String, Date, Random, Scanner (Java) |
| Custom | Created by programmers to define new data types | Animal, Person, Vehicle |

**Terminology:**
- **Class variables** - attributes defined within a class
- **Instance variables** - attributes belonging to a specific object
- **Identifier** - the name used to refer to an object

---

## 2. Objects

An **object** is a specific instance of a class, representing a real-world entity (e.g., teacher, car, phone).

**Key Points:**
- Created from a class with its own unique values for properties
- Has its own **state** (current values of attributes) and **behaviours** (methods it can perform)
- Multiple objects can be created from the same class, each with different attribute values

**Constructor:**
- A special method automatically called when an object is instantiated
- Defines initial values of instance variables
- Performs necessary setup to prepare the object for use

**Example Instantiation:**
```
mushypeas = new ItemForSale("mushy peas", 0.89)
```

## 3. Methods

A **method** is a function or procedure associated with objects or classes that defines behaviours and actions.

**Types of Methods:**
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Function | Performs a task and **returns a value** |
| Procedure | Performs a task but **does not return a value** |

**Calling Methods:**
- Use **dot notation**: `objectName.methodName()`
- Example: `jumboJet.Takeoff()`

**Access Modifiers:**

| Public Methods | Private Methods |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Accessible from any code within or outside the class | Only accessible within the same class |
| Can be invoked by external classes | Cannot be invoked by external code |
| Changes may impact other parts of the codebase | Changes have localised impact only |
| Default if no modifier specified | Used for internal implementation details |

**Method Types:**
- **Instance methods** - operate on specific object data
- **Static methods** - associated with the class itself; can be called without creating an object

---

## 4. Attributes

An **attribute** is a data member or property associated with an object or class.

**Key Points:**
- Defines the **state** of an object
- Can have different values for different instances of the same class
- Can be various data types: integers, strings, Booleans, or other objects
- Can have different access rights (public/private)

**Attribute Declaration Components:**
1. **Access modifier** (public/private)
2. **Data type** (String, Integer, Boolean, etc.)
3. **Attribute name**

**Important Note:**
- Local variables (declared within methods) cannot have access modifiers
- Local variables are only accessible within the block/method where declared

---

## 5. Inheritance

**Inheritance** allows a class to inherit properties and behaviours (methods and attributes) from another class.

**Terminology:**
| Term | Alternative Names |
|------|-------------------|
| Base class | Parent class, Superclass |
| Derived class | Child class, Subclass |

**Key Concepts:**
- Establishes an **"IS-A" relationship** (e.g., "a Car IS-A Vehicle")
- Promotes **code reuse** - avoids duplicating code
- Derived classes can:
  - Access and use inherited methods/attributes
  - Add additional attributes and methods
  - Override inherited methods

**The `super` Keyword:**
- Used to refer to the superclass from within a subclass
- Accesses parent class members (methods, attributes, constructors)

**Example Structure:**
```
Base Class: Vehicle
├── Attributes: Manufacturer, Make, Cost
├── Methods: TurnEngineOn(), TurnEngineOff(), SteerLeft(), SteerRight()
│
├── Derived Class: Car
│   ├── Additional Attributes: IsInsured, EngineCapacity
│   └── Additional Methods: GearChange(), UnlockDoors()
│
└── Derived Class: Truck
    ├── Additional Attributes: IsRefrigerated, TotalCargoArea
    └── Additional Methods: ReleaseTrailer(), UnlockTrailerDoors()
```

## 6. Encapsulation

**Encapsulation** is the practice of grouping data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a class, while controlling access to them.

**Purpose:**
- **Data security** - prevents accidental modification or misuse
- **Organisation** - keeps related data and methods together
- **Code reusability** - same class can be used in different parts of a program
- **Abstraction** - hides implementation details, reducing complexity

**How It Works:**

| Component | Access | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Private attributes | Only within class | Protects data from external modification |
| Public methods | From anywhere | Provides controlled interface to access/modify private data |

**Getters and Setters:**
- **Getter** - public method that returns the value of a private attribute
- **Setter** - public method that modifies the value of a private attribute

**Example:**
```
private distance  // Cannot be accessed directly
public procedure updateDistance(givenDistance)
    distance = givenDistance
endprocedure
```

## 7. Polymorphism

**Polymorphism** allows objects to take on different forms or behaviours - different objects can share the same name/behaviour but work in different ways.

**Benefits:**
- Makes code more **flexible, reusable, and maintainable**
- Objects can be treated as belonging to a common group even if from different classes

**Types of Polymorphism:**

### Method Overloading
- Multiple methods with the **same name** but **different parameters** within the same class
- Compiler determines which method to call based on arguments

### Method Overriding
- A derived class provides a **new implementation** for a method already defined in the parent class
- Uses the `override` keyword
- The method in the subclass replaces the parent's version

**Example:**
```
Base Class: Animal
    move() → prints "I am going to move somehow"

Derived Class: Fish
    override move() → prints "I am a fish swimming"

Derived Class: Bear
    override move() → prints "I am a bear lumbering around"
```

**Treating Objects as Common Groups:**
```
Vehicle vehicle1 = new Car()
Vehicle vehicle2 = new Motorcycle()
```
- Both can be stored in an array of type Vehicle
- When calling methods, the **object's own class method** is executed
- `vehicle1.displayInfo()` outputs "I am a Car!"
- `vehicle2.displayInfo()` outputs "I am a Motorcycle!"

## Summary Table: Core OOP Concepts

| Concept | Definition | Key Benefit |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Class** | Blueprint/template for creating objects | Reusable, modular code |
| **Object** | Instance of a class with its own state | Represents real-world entities |
| **Method** | Function/procedure defining object behaviour | Defines actions objects can perform |
| **Attribute** | Data member defining object state | Stores object properties |
| **Inheritance** | Derived class inherits from base class | Code reuse, avoids duplication |
| **Encapsulation** | Grouping data/methods with access control | Data security, abstraction |
| **Polymorphism** | Objects taking different forms/behaviours | Flexibility, maintainability |

## Exam Tips

1. **Methods vs Functions vs Procedures**: A method can be either a function (returns value) or procedure (no return value)

2. **Default access**: If no access modifier specified, assume **public**

3. **Local variables**: Cannot have access modifiers; only accessible within their block/method

4. **Instantiation syntax**: Know both formats:
   - `objectName = new ClassName(parameters)`
   - `ClassName objectName = new ClassName(parameters)`

5. **Inheritance terminology**: Be prepared to use parent/child, base/derived, or superclass/subclass interchangeably

6. **Encapsulation example**: Private attribute + public setter method = encapsulation

7. **Polymorphism**: Remember both overloading (same name, different parameters) and overriding (same name, new implementation in subclass)
