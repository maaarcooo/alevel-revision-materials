## 1. Networks - Characteristics and Fundamentals

### What is a Network?
A **network** is two or more computers connected together with the ability to transmit data between each other. Networks enable:
- Data and resource sharing
- Communication
- Collaboration

### Types of Networks

**Local Area Network (LAN)**
- Spread over a small geographical area or single site (e.g., school, office)
- All hardware is owned by a single entity
- More secure than WANs
- Connected using hubs/switches and routers

**Wide Area Network (WAN)**
- Spread over a large geographical area
- Connects multiple LANs
- Uses third-party connections (leased lines, fibre, satellite)
- Infrastructure owned by ISPs or telecommunications companies
- Example: The Internet (largest WAN)

## 2. Protocols and Standards

### Protocols
A **protocol** is a set of rules defining how two computers communicate with each other. Protocols are standardised so all devices can communicate regardless of manufacturer.

### Common Internet Protocols

| Protocol | Full Name | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **HTTP** | Hypertext Transfer Protocol | Web page rendering and content transfer |
| **HTTPS** | HTTP Secure | Encrypted version of HTTP for secure transactions |
| **TCP/IP** | Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol | Routing packets through networks |
| **SMTP** | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol | Sending email messages between servers |
| **POP3/IMAP** | Post Office Protocol/Internet Message Access Protocol | Email access |
| **FTP** | File Transfer Protocol | File transmission over networks |
| **ARP** | Address Resolution Protocol | Translates IP addresses to MAC addresses |
| **UDP** | User Datagram Protocol | Faster, connectionless protocol without delivery guarantees |

### Importance of Standards
- Enable different devices to work together seamlessly (interoperability)
- Ensure data is correctly interpreted regardless of sender/receiver
- Support network expansion without disrupting operations
- Foster innovation and competition

## 3. The TCP/IP Stack

The TCP/IP stack is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. It consists of **four layers**:

### Application Layer
- **Highest layer** - interacts directly with software applications
- Specifies which protocol to use (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP)
- Prepares data for transmission by converting it into a network-friendly format (encapsulation)

### Transport Layer
- Receives data from the application layer
- **Establishes end-to-end connection** between source and destination
- **Breaks data into packets** and assigns:
  - Port number (for correct reassembly)
  - Packet number and total packet count
  - Header with metadata
- **Requests retransmission** of lost packets
- Uses TCP protocol

### Internet Layer (Network Layer)
- Receives packets from the transport layer
- **Adds IP addresses**: source and destination
- **Routes packets** across networks using IP addresses
- Combination of IP address + port number = **socket address**
- Routers operate at this layer

### Link Layer (Network Interface Layer)
- **Lowest layer** - creates physical connection between network devices
- Adds **MAC addresses** (source and destination Network Interface Card addresses)
- Translates digital packets into electrical/optical/wireless signals
- For same network: destination MAC = recipient computer
- For different network: destination MAC = router

### Data Flow
**Sending:**
Application → Transport → Internet → Link → Physical transmission

**Receiving:**
Physical reception → Link → Internet → Transport → Application

At each layer, specific headers are added. When received, layers are processed in reverse, removing headers and performing specific tasks.

## 4. Domain Name System (DNS)

### What is DNS?
The **Domain Name System** is a directory that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use.

### DNS Hierarchy
- **TLD** (Top Level Domain): e.g., .com, .uk, .org
- **2LD** (Second Level Domain): e.g., google in google.com
- Each domain separated by a full stop

### DNS Resolution Process
1. **URL Entry**: User enters website address in browser
2. **Local Cache Check**: Computer checks if IP address is cached
3. **DNS Query**: Browser sends query to DNS server (usually ISP)
4. **DNS Resolver**: Checks cache for IP address
5. **Root Server Query**: If not cached, queries DNS root servers for TLD
6. **TLD Server Query**: Root server directs to TLD server (.com, .org, etc.)
7. **Authoritative Server Query**: TLD provides IP of authoritative DNS server
8. **Retrieve IP Address**: Authoritative server responds with IP address
9. **Request Web Page**: Browser sends HTTP/HTTPS request to IP address
10. **Server Response**: Server sends webpage data
11. **Render Page**: Browser displays the webpage

### Benefits of DNS
- Easy to remember domain names instead of IP addresses
- Centralised management of domain-to-IP mappings
- Automatic handling of IP address changes

## 5. Data Packets

### Packet Structure

**Header** contains:
- **Source IP address**: Origin of packet
- **Destination IP address**: Where packet should go
- **Protocol**: How to interpret the packet
- **Packet order/sequence number**: For correct reassembly
- **Time To Live (TTL)/Hop Limit**: When packet should expire
- **Port number**: Identifies the application

**Payload**:
- The actual data being transmitted

**Trailer**:
- **Checksum** or **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**: Error detection code

---

## 6. Packet Switching vs Circuit Switching

### Packet Switching
Data is broken into packets and sent independently across the network. Each packet can take a different route.

**Advantages:**
- Efficient use of network resources (bandwidth)
- Multiple routes available (resilient to failures)
- Only lost packets need retransmission
- Lower cost (shared resources)
- Can transfer over very large networks

**Disadvantages:**
- Not ideal for real-time services (video calls, VoIP)
- Packets can arrive out of order (requires reassembly)
- Time spent deconstructing and reconstructing data
- Network congestion possible

### Circuit Switching
A dedicated communication path is established between two devices for the entire duration of communication.

**Advantages:**
- Ideal for real-time services (constant data transmission)
- No delays (dedicated path)
- Data arrives in logical order (quicker reconstruction)

**Disadvantages:**
- Less efficient (bandwidth wasted during silence)
- More costly (dedicated line)
- Less flexible and scalable
- Devices must transmit/receive at same rate
- Path cannot be used by others during transmission

**Note:** Avoid discussing "speed" of transmission - instead focus on bitrate, bandwidth, or efficiency.

## 7. Network Security and Threats

### Common Network Threats

**Hackers**
- Exploit system vulnerabilities for unauthorised access
- Aims: personal gain, activism, cyber espionage

**Viruses**
- Malicious software that spreads and interferes with operations
- Attaches to legitimate programs
- Can delete data or damage hardware

**Malware Types:**
- **Worm**: Standalone program that self-replicates over networks
- **Trojan Horse**: Disguises as legitimate software but causes harm
- **Spyware**: Records keystrokes and transmits to third parties
- **Adware**: Displays unwanted advertisements
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts files and demands payment for decryption

**Denial of Service (DoS)**
- Floods server with requests causing it to crash
- Denies legitimate users access

**Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**
- Uses multiple computers (bots) to flood server
- More powerful than DoS

**SQL Injection**
- Malicious SQL statements inserted into entry fields
- Can expose database to hackers

**Phishing**
- Masquerading as trustworthy entity via email
- Contains link to fake website to steal credentials

**Pharming**

### Network Security Measures

**Firewalls**
- Prevents unauthorised access to networks
- Uses **packet filtering**: examines source IP, destination IP, protocols, and ports
- Compares packets against preconfigured rules
- Can **drop** (silently discard) or **reject** (send alert) packets

**Proxy Servers**
- Acts as intermediary between user and internet
- Benefits:
  - Protects user privacy (anonymous)
  - Caches frequently used data (faster loading)
  - Reduces web traffic
  - Can filter/block access to certain content

**Encryption**
- Makes data unreadable if intercepted
- Uses keys to encrypt and decrypt data
- Essential for secure data transmission

**Additional Measures:**

## 8. Network Hardware

### Network Interface Card (NIC)
- Hardware component enabling device to connect to network
- Usually built into motherboard
- Provides ethernet port for wired connection
- Assigns unique **MAC address** (48-bit, 12-digit hexadecimal)
- Converts computer data into network-friendly format

### Modem
- **Modulator-Demodulator**
- Converts digital signals to analogue (and vice versa)
- Enables data transmission over telephone/cable lines
- Used for DSL, cable, or dial-up connections

### Router
- Connects two or more networks (e.g., LAN to WAN/Internet)
- Routes data packets between networks
- Determines best path for packets to reach destination
- Has public IP address assigned by ISP
- May include firewall and wireless capabilities
- Reads packet headers (IP addresses) to forward packets
- Uses routing tables to determine next hop
- Each router-to-router pass = one "hop"

### Switch
- Connects devices on a network
- Directs data only to intended device (unlike hub)
- Uses **lookup table** mapping MAC addresses to ports
- Examines destination MAC address
- Forwards packet to corresponding port
- More efficient and secure than hubs

### Hub
- Connects multiple devices on a network
- "Dumb" device - broadcasts data to all connected devices
- Creates unnecessary traffic
- Security concerns (all devices receive all data)
- Cheaper than switches but less efficient

### Wireless Access Point (WAP)
- Central transmitter/receiver of Wi-Fi signals
- Connects to wired network via ethernet/fibre optic
- Projects Wi-Fi signal to designated area
- Multiple WAPs provide extensive coverage

### Gateway
- Used when protocols differ between networks
- Translates protocols for communication
- Removes old protocol headers, adds new protocol headers

### Cables
- **Ethernet cables** (Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6): Various speeds (10 Mbps to 10 Gbps)
- **Fibre-optic cables**: Use light, much higher speed and capacity

## 9. Client-Server vs Peer-to-Peer Networks

### Client-Server

**Structure:**
- Powerful central **server** controls the network
- **Clients** (terminals) connect to server
- Server hosts, delivers, and manages resources
- Clients request services from server

**Advantages:**
- Easier central management
- Scalable (easy to add clients)
- Higher reliability (centrally managed resources)
- More secure (data stored in one location)

- Data spread across network
- Each user responsible for own security and backups

**Advantages:**
- Easy to set up
- Less expensive (no server needed)
- No dependency on central server
- No specialist staff required
- Easy to maintain
- Direct file sharing between devices

**Disadvantages:**
- Lack of central control (security issues)
- Not suitable for large networks (performance issues)
- Backups must be performed separately on each device
- Poorer security
- Difficult to locate resources
- Impossible to trace origin of files

**Use Case:** Home networks, small businesses, file sharing applications
