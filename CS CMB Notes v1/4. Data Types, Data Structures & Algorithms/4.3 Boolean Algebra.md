## 1. Boolean Logic and Logic Gates

### What is Boolean Logic?
- Boolean logic is used to make **logical decisions** based on binary values (TRUE/FALSE or 1/0)
- Boolean operators can only be TRUE or FALSE, never both
- Inputs and outputs are represented by letters (typically A, B, C, etc.)
- Boolean logic ≠ Boolean algebra:
  - **Boolean logic**: principles of logic based on binary values
  - **Boolean algebra**: mathematical system used to manipulate Boolean values

### Order of Operations
When evaluating Boolean expressions with multiple operators:
1. **Brackets** (highest priority)
2. **NOT**
3. **AND**
4. **OR** (lowest priority)

### Four Main Logic Gates

#### 1. Conjunction (AND)
- **Symbol**: ∧ or .
- **Gate**: ![AND gate symbol - D-shaped gate]
- **Returns TRUE** only if **both** inputs are TRUE
- Think of it as **multiplication** (1 × 1 = 1)

**Truth Table:**
| A | B | A ∧ B |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 0     |
| 0 | 1 | 0     |
| 1 | 0 | 0     |
| 1 | 1 | 1     |

#### 2. Disjunction (OR)
- **Symbol**: ∨ or +
- **Gate**: ![OR gate symbol - curved D-shaped gate]
- **Returns TRUE** if **either** input is TRUE
- Think of it as **addition** (at least one is 1)

**Truth Table:**
| A | B | A ∨ B |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 0     |
| 0 | 1 | 1     |
| 1 | 0 | 1     |
| 1 | 1 | 1     |

#### 3. Negation (NOT)
- **Symbol**: ¬ or ‾
- **Gate**: ![NOT gate symbol - triangle with circle]
- **Inverts** the input value
- Only operates on **one** literal

**Truth Table:**
| A | ¬A |
|---|----|
| 0 | 1  |
| 1 | 0  |

#### 4. Exclusive Disjunction (XOR)
- **Symbol**: ⊕ or ∨̲
- **Gate**: ![XOR gate symbol - OR gate with extra curved line]
- **Returns TRUE** if inputs are **different**
- Returns FALSE if inputs are the **same**

**Truth Table:**
| A | B | A ⊕ B |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 0     |
| 0 | 1 | 1     |
| 1 | 0 | 1     |
| 1 | 1 | 0     |

### Truth Tables
- Show **every possible permutation** of inputs and corresponding outputs
- For n inputs, there are 2ⁿ rows
- Used to verify the behaviour of Boolean expressions

## 2. Karnaugh Maps (K-Maps)

### What are Karnaugh Maps?
- A **visual method** for simplifying Boolean algebra expressions
- More powerful than algebraic methods alone
- Works by **grouping** terms with common factors

### Creating a Karnaugh Map

#### For 2 Variables (A, B):
```
       A
    +---+---+
    | 0 | 1 |
  +---+---+---+
B | 0 |   |   |
  +---+---+---+
  | 1 |   |   |
  +---+---+---+
```

#### For 3 Variables (A, B, C):
```
    AB  00  01  11  10
    +---+---+---+---+
C 0 |   |   |   |   |
    +---+---+---+---+
  1 |   |   |   |   |
    +---+---+---+---+
```

#### For 4 Variables (A, B, C, D):
```
      AB  00  01  11  10
    +---+---+---+---+---+
CD 00 |   |   |   |   |
    +---+---+---+---+---+
   01 |   |   |   |   |
    +---+---+---+---+---+
   11 |   |   |   |   |
    +---+---+---+---+---+
   10 |   |   |   |   |
    +---+---+---+---+---+
```

**Key Point**: Use **Gray code** - adjacent cells differ by only **one bit** (including wraparound)

### Steps to Simplify Using K-Maps

1. **Create the map**: Fill cells with 1s where the expression is TRUE, 0s elsewhere
2. **Group the 1s**: 
   - Groups must be **rectangular**
   - Group sizes must be **powers of 2** (1, 2, 4, 8)
   - Make groups as **large as possible**
   - Groups can **overlap**
   - Groups can **wrap around** edges
3. **Simplify each group**: 
   - Identify variables that remain **constant** in the group
   - These become your simplified term
4. **OR the groups together**: Final expression is all groups OR'd together

### Example
For expression: ¬A∧¬B∧C ∨ ¬A∧B∧¬C ∨ A∧¬B∧C ∨ A∧B

1. Fill in K-map with 1s for each term
2. Group the 1s (vertical group for A¬B, horizontal groups for ¬B¬C and A¬C)
3. Simplified expression: **A¬B ∨ ¬B¬C ∨ A¬C**

## 3. Simplifying Boolean Algebra

### General Rules

#### AND Rules
- X ∧ 0 = 0
- X ∧ 1 = X
- X ∧ X = X
- ¬X ∧ X = 0

#### OR Rules
- X ∨ 0 = X
- X ∨ 1 = 1
- X ∨ X = X
- ¬X ∨ X = 1

### De Morgan's Laws
**Breaking a negation and changing the operator**

**Law 1**: ¬(A ∧ B) ≡ ¬A ∨ ¬B
- NOT(AND) becomes OR with negated terms

**Law 2**: ¬(A ∨ B) ≡ ¬A ∧ ¬B
- NOT(OR) becomes AND with negated terms

**Steps to apply De Morgan's Law:**
1. Change AND to OR (or vice versa)
2. NOT each term either side of the operator
3. NOT the entire expression
4. Remove double negations

**Example**: ¬(A ∧ B) → ¬(¬A ∨ ¬B) → ¬¬(¬A ∨ ¬B) → ¬A ∨ ¬B

**Real-life example**: "I don't like both tea and coffee" = "I don't like tea OR I don't like coffee"

### Distribution
**How AND and OR interact with each other** (like factorising in maths)

**Conjunction over Disjunction:**
- A ∧ (B ∨ C) ≡ (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C)

**Disjunction over Conjunction:**
- A ∨ (B ∧ C) ≡ (A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∨ C)

**Same operators:**
- A ∧ (B ∧ C) ≡ (A ∧ B) ∧ (A ∧ C)
- A ∨ (B ∨ C) ≡ (A ∨ B) ∨ (A ∨ C)

**Real-life example**: "Pick one subject from group A and either one from group B or group C" = "Pick one from A and one from B, OR pick one from A and one from C"

### Association
**Removing brackets and regrouping variables**

- (A ∧ B) ∧ C ≡ A ∧ (B ∧ C) ≡ A ∧ B ∧ C
- (A ∨ B) ∨ C ≡ A ∨ (B ∨ C) ≡ A ∨ B ∨ C

**Real-life example**: "Zarmeen and her friends, Zahra and Ella" = "Zarmeen and Zahra, and their friend Ella" = "Zarmeen, Zahra and Ella"

### Commutation
**Order doesn't matter**

- A ∧ B ≡ B ∧ A
- A ∨ B ≡ B ∨ A

**Real-life example**: "Fynn and George won medals" = "George and Fynn won medals"

### Double Negation
**Two negations cancel out**

- ¬¬A ≡ A
- NOT(NOT(A)) = A

**Real-life example**: "I don't not want to visit" = "I do want to visit"

## 4. Logic Circuits

### D-Type Flip Flop

#### Purpose
- Stores the state of **1 bit** of data
- Basic unit of computer memory
- Type of **bistable circuit** (two stable states)

#### Components
- **Data input (D)**: The bit to store
- **Clock input (CLK)**: Regular pulse to synchronise operation
- **Two outputs**: Q and ¬Q

#### Operation
- **Edge-triggered**: Changes only on the **rising edge** of the clock pulse (when clock goes from 0 to 1)
- On rising edge:
  - If D = 1, then Q = 1 (and ¬Q = 0)
  - If D = 0, then Q = 0 (and ¬Q = 1)
- Q **remembers** its value until the next rising clock edge

#### Key Points
- Can be built from **NAND gates**
- Multiple flip-flops can be combined to form **registers**
- Also called **Positive Edge Triggered**

#### Exam Tip
When drawing timing diagrams:
1. Draw vertical lines at each rising clock edge
2. At each line, Q takes the current value of D
3. Q remains constant between rising edges

### Half Adder

#### Purpose
- Adds **two single-bit binary numbers**
- Produces a **Sum** and **Carry** output

#### Components
- **Two inputs**: A and B
- **Two outputs**: 
  - **Sum (S)**: The XOR of A and B
  - **Carry (C)**: The AND of A and B

#### Truth Table
| A | B | Carry | Sum |
|---|---|-------|-----|
| 0 | 0 | 0     | 0   |
| 0 | 1 | 0     | 1   |
| 1 | 0 | 0     | 1   |
| 1 | 1 | 1     | 0   |

**Remember**: You're adding A + B and writing the answer as 2-bit binary (Carry + Sum)
- Example: 1 + 1 = 2 = 10 in binary, so Carry=1, Sum=0

#### Circuit
- **XOR gate**: Produces Sum
- **AND gate**: Produces Carry

---

### Full Adder

#### Purpose
- Adds **three single-bit binary numbers** (extends half adder)
- Essential for **multi-bit addition**

#### Components
- **Three inputs**: A, B, and Carry In (Cᵢₙ)
- **Two outputs**: 
  - **Sum (S)**: The XOR of A, B, and Cᵢₙ
  - **Carry Out (Cₒᵤₜ)**: TRUE if at least two inputs are TRUE

#### Truth Table
| A | B | Cᵢₙ | Cₒᵤₜ | Sum |
|---|---|-----|------|-----|
| 0 | 0 | 0   | 0    | 0   |
| 0 | 0 | 1   | 0    | 1   |
| 0 | 1 | 0   | 0    | 1   |
| 0 | 1 | 1   | 1    | 0   |
| 1 | 0 | 0   | 0    | 1   |
| 1 | 0 | 1   | 1    | 0   |
| 1 | 1 | 0   | 1    | 0   |
| 1 | 1 | 1   | 1    | 1   |

**Remember**: Add A + B + Cᵢₙ and write answer as 2-bit binary
- Example: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 = 11 in binary, so Cₒᵤₜ=1, Sum=1

#### Circuit
Made from:
- **Two half adders** (one for A+B, one for result+Cᵢₙ)
- **One OR gate** (combines the two carry outputs)

#### Multi-bit Addition
To add two 4-bit numbers:
- Chain **4 full adders** together
- Carry out from one connects to carry in of the next
- This forms a **ripple adder**

## Exam Tips

### For Truth Tables
- Always work **systematically** through all combinations
- For 2 inputs: 4 rows (2²)
- For 3 inputs: 8 rows (2³)
- For 4 inputs: 16 rows (2⁴)

### For Karnaugh Maps
- **Always show your groupings** by drawing boxes/circles
- Start with the **largest possible groups**
- Don't forget **wraparound** is allowed
- Each group must contain a **power of 2** cells (1, 2, 4, 8)

### For Boolean Simplification
- Show **each step** of your working
- State which **law** you're applying
- Check your final answer by creating a truth table

### For Logic Circuits
- **D-Type Flip Flops**: Remember it only changes on the **rising edge**
- **Half Adder**: Just A + B
- **Full Adder**: A + B + Carry In

## Quick Reference: Boolean Algebra Laws

| Law | Formula | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| Identity (AND) | X ∧ 1 = X | AND with 1 gives X |
| Identity (OR) | X ∨ 0 = X | OR with 0 gives X |
| Null (AND) | X ∧ 0 = 0 | AND with 0 gives 0 |
| Null (OR) | X ∨ 1 = 1 | OR with 1 gives 1 |
| Idempotent | X ∧ X = X, X ∨ X = X | Variable with itself |
| Complement (AND) | X ∧ ¬X = 0 | Variable AND its inverse = 0 |
| Complement (OR) | X ∨ ¬X = 1 | Variable OR its inverse = 1 |
| Double Negation | ¬¬X = X | Two NOTs cancel |
| De Morgan's | ¬(A ∧ B) = ¬A ∨ ¬B | NOT(AND) = OR(NOTs) |
| De Morgan's | ¬(A ∨ B) = ¬A ∧ ¬B | NOT(OR) = AND(NOTs) |
| Commutative | A ∧ B = B ∧ A | Order doesn't matter |
| Associative | (A ∧ B) ∧ C = A ∧ (B ∧ C) | Grouping doesn't matter |
| Distributive | A ∧ (B ∨ C) = (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C) | Distribute AND over OR |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Confusing XOR with OR**: XOR returns FALSE when both inputs are TRUE
2. **Forgetting Gray code**: K-map columns must differ by only one bit
3. **Missing wraparound groups**: K-map edges wrap around
4. **Wrong operator precedence**: Remember NOT > AND > OR
5. **Flip-flop timing**: Changes only on rising edge, not continuously
