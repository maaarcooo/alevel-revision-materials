## The Data Protection Act 1998

### Overview
The Data Protection Act (DPA) is legislation that **protects personal data from being misused**. It applies to information stored on computers and in organised paper filing systems.

**Personal Data** = any data that can be used to identify a living person, either alone or in combination with other data.
- Examples: name, address, date of birth, race, religion

**Data Subject** = an individual who can be identified by personal data.

**Important Note:** The DPA 1998 was replaced by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 in 2018.

### Exemptions
Not all data processing is subject to the DPA:
- **Domestic purposes** - personal use (e.g., writing to friends/family, personal photos)
- **Law enforcement** - police investigations (suspects cannot request to see evidence)
- **Intelligence services** - data processed by MI5, MI6, etc.

### The Eight Data Protection Principles

| Principle | Requirement | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **1. Fair and lawful processing** | Companies must be clear about what personal data they collect and why | A school requests data to contact guardians in emergencies |
| **2. Specified and lawful purposes** | Data cannot be used for purposes other than those originally stated, or passed on without permission | A company asks for a phone number for delivery but then uses it for marketing |
| **3. Adequate, relevant and not excessive** | Cannot request unnecessary data | A bank cannot ask about previous trips when opening an account |
| **4. Accurate and up to date** | Data subjects have the right to correct or delete inaccurate/outdated data | A bank must update a customer's old address to send statements |
| **5. Not kept longer than necessary** | Data must be deleted once no longer needed | When a customer closes an account, their data must be deleted |
| **6. Processed in line with rights** | Companies must provide data to subjects on request | A hospital must provide a patient's full records if requested |
| **7. Held securely** | Security measures (usernames, passwords) and backups required | A company makes external backups on the cloud |
| **8. Not transferred outside EEA** | Cannot transfer data to countries outside the European Economic Area unless they have adequate protection | Cannot send data to countries without adequate data protection laws |

### Rights of Individuals (Data Subjects)
- To be informed about collection and use of their data
- To access their personal data
- To have inaccurate data rectified or completed
- To be forgotten (in certain circumstances)
- To restrict processing (in certain circumstances)
- To data portability (obtain and reuse data across different services)
- To object to processing (in certain circumstances)
- Rights regarding automated decision making and profiling
- To withdraw consent at any time
- To complain to the Information Commissioner

### Actions Companies Must Take
- Appoint a **Data Controller** responsible for ensuring compliance with DPA principles
- Implement physical or digital security measures to prevent unauthorised access
- Train staff to abide by the principles
- Respond to **Subject Access Requests (SAR)** - must send a secure copy of the subject's data after verifying identity
- Face large fines if found in breach of the Act

### Exam Tips
- **Explain, don't just state** the principles
  - Example: "Personal data must be fairly and lawfully processed, which means companies must collect personal information with a lawful reason to have the data"
- OCR accepts interpretations based on when the specification was set (2015) or when the exam is sat - you can include GDPR

## The Computer Misuse Act 1990

### Overview
The Computer Misuse Act (CMA) concerns the **malicious use of computers**. Originally created to ensure computer hacking was covered by law, it has been regularly updated to remain relevant.

### Three Primary Offences

**1. Unauthorised access to computer materials**
- Example: Finding a teacher's password and opening their files

**2. Unauthorised access with intent to commit further offences**
- Example: Finding a teacher's password and opening their files with the intention of increasing your mark

**3. Unauthorised modification of computer material**
- Example: Finding a teacher's password, opening their files, and actually increasing your mark

**Consequences:** Each offence is punishable with imprisonment, with penalties worsening from offence 1 to 3.

### Security Features to Prevent Unauthorised Access
- **Digital signatures** or certificates
- **Firewalls** to prevent external access and DoS/DDoS attacks
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access controls
- Security monitoring
- Regular penetration testing

### Exam Tips
- Don't just describe the law - **relate it to the scenario**
- Consider: How does the CMA affect the company in the scenario?
- What are the consequences of the actions taken?

## The Copyright, Design and Patents Act 1988

### Overview
This Act protects the **intellectual property** of individuals or companies. It covers everything from logos to music recordings, videos, and computer programs.

### Key Features
- If work is **original**, copyright **automatically applies**
- Copyright doesn't expire until **25-70 years after the death of the creator** (depending on type of work)
- In **1992**, extended to include **computer programs** as literary work - copyright automatically applies to code
- It is the **creator's responsibility** to take action if their work is copied

### What is Prohibited

**Primary Breaches:**
- Copying an original work
- Issuing the copy to the public
- Renting/lending the copy to the public
- Performing, showing or playing the work in public
- Making an adaptation of the original work

**Secondary Breaches:**
- Importing a copy of original work
- Possessing or dealing with a copy
- Providing means to make copies
- Permitting use of premises for making copies
- Provision of props/equipment for a performance of a copy

### Modern Applications
- Illegal downloads of copyrighted software/videos prevent copyright holders from earning income
- Covers peer-to-peer streaming of videos and audio
- Example: Downloading videos from Netflix and sharing them would breach the Act

### Exam Tips
- Specify that the Act covers **original work** and is **automatically applied** from creation
- Use the **full name** - "The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act" (not just "Copyright Act")
- Explain what this means for distribution
  - Example: "The work was protected by the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act when it was created. Therefore if anyone wishes to distribute it they have to gain the owner's permission. If they just posted it to the internet, this would be in breach of the Act."

## The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000

### Overview
The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) legislates how organisations can **monitor electronic communications**. It covers **investigation, surveillance and interception of communication** by public bodies.

### Key Features
- Certain actions require government approval
- Different organisations have different limits (GCHQ has most freedom)
- Example: MI6 can legally wiretap online conversations in the interests of national security, **provided a warrant has been issued**

### Requirements for ISPs and Mobile Phone Companies
The Act **enforces** Internet Service Providers and mobile phone companies to:
- Give up information upon request from authorised authorities
- Ensure their networks have sufficient hardware installed to **facilitate surveillance**

### Powers Granted to Public Bodies
- Demand ISPs provide access to customer communications
- Allow mass surveillance of communications
- Demand access to protected information
- Monitor an individual's internet activities
- Prevent the existence of interception activities being revealed in court

### Impact on Businesses
- Must provide access to digital communications or data when requested
- Must implement hardware and software solutions that facilitate storage of digital communications

### Controversy
The Act is controversial because:
- Powers extend to **small agencies like local councils**
- Many view it as an **invasion of privacy**
- Concerns about **improper use**
- Examples of misuse: monitoring dog walkers, fly tippers, and families to check school catchment areas

### Exam Tips
- Use technical terms precisely:
  - **Surveillance** = the use of technology to gather information on people
  - **Communication** = done electronically
- Don't generalise these terms

## Key Terms Summary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Personal Data** | Any data that can identify a living person |
| **Data Subject** | Individual who can be identified by personal data |
| **Data Controller** | Person responsible for ensuring DPA compliance |
| **SAR (Subject Access Request)** | Request by data subject to see their data |
| **Copyright** | Legal protection for original creative work |
| **Intellectual Property** | Creations of the mind (inventions, designs, etc.) |
| **Unauthorised Access** | Accessing computer systems without permission |
| **Surveillance** | Monitoring using technology |
