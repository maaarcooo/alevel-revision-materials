## 5.2 Moral & Ethical Issues - Revision Notes

---

## Introduction

**Ethics** are concerned with our values as a community and how these impact different groups of people in society.

**Morals** relate to our personal code of conduct and encompass how we choose to behave, including decisions we make at the expense of others.

With computers integrated into almost every aspect of daily life, it's essential to consider the **moral, ethical, environmental, social and cultural implications** of technological changes.

- Support for **bi-directional text** (left-to-right and right-to-left)

### Implications

**Cultural Sensitivity:**
- Respect cultural values and traditions
- Avoid cultural stereotypes
- Provide culturally appropriate symbols and context
- Language and character sets must accommodate global users
