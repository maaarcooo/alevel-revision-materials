# 6.5 Thinking Concurrently

## Concurrent Thinking

**Concurrent thinking** is the cognitive process of identifying and applying concurrency to problem-solving. It involves recognising which parts of a problem can be tackled simultaneously rather than sequentially.

**Key characteristics:**
- Built upon the concept of concurrent processing
- Involves completing more than one task at any given time
- Uses human cognition rather than computer processors
- Focuses on identifying patterns where concurrency can be applied

**Example:**
If given two tasks: (1) record number plates of passing cars, and (2) record colours of passing cars, concurrent thinking involves recording both attributes for each car before moving to the next, rather than completing all number plates first and then all colours.

**Determining concurrent tasks:**
To identify which parts of a problem can be solved simultaneously, assess which sections are **related**. Related sections can often be solved concurrently.

## Concurrent Processing vs Parallel Processing

### Concurrent Processing

**Concurrent processing** allows multiple processes/tasks to run on a **single processor** by allocating each process a fraction of time (time slice) and control over the processor before swapping to another process.

**How it works:**
- Each task receives a slice of processor time
- Tasks are rapidly switched (pipelined) to create the illusion of simultaneous execution
- Tasks are actually executed **sequentially**, not simultaneously
- Human perception interprets this as simultaneous due to slow information processing speeds (microsecond-level switching)

### Parallel Processing

**Parallel processing** involves using **multiple processors** to complete more than one task truly simultaneously.

**How it works:**
- Multiple processes run at the same time over multiple processor cores
- Enables genuinely simultaneous execution
- Used in multicore processors

### Key Distinction

| Aspect | Concurrent Processing | Parallel Processing |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Processors** | Single processor | Multiple processors/cores |
| **Execution** | Sequential (time-sliced) | Truly simultaneous |
| **Mechanism** | Time slices create illusion | Multiple cores work together |
| **Example** | OS running virus scan and game on single core | Video editing software using multiple cores |

## Determining Where Concurrent Processing Can Be Used

### Dependencies

**Dependencies** are tasks that rely on other tasks to either start or complete. Understanding dependencies is crucial for determining which tasks can run concurrently.

**Examples of dependencies:**
1. **Construction:** A roofer cannot put a roof on a house if the walls aren't fully built, and walls cannot be built unless the foundation is in place
2. **Financial calculations:** A person's taxes cannot be calculated until all income has been input and all deductibles taken into account

### Independent Tasks

Tasks without dependencies can often be processed concurrently or in parallel:

**Batch programs:** When running batch programs on data sets (e.g., climate data analysis, departmental finances):
- If data sets do not relate, rely on, or interact with each other, they can run in **parallel** on multiple cores
- This increases time efficiency and maximises resource usage

**Multiple batch programs:** If different batch programs need to run, they can be interchanged and pipelined using **concurrent processing** on the same processor, allowing multiple programs to make progress in a shorter time frame.

## Benefits of Concurrent Processing

1. **Increased program throughput**
   - The number of tasks completed in a given time frame is increased
   - Example: ten programs could be half finished versus two that may finish to completion

2. **Reduced waiting time**
   - Less time is wasted waiting for input or user interaction
   - While one task waits for user input, other tasks can be completed
   - The processor can swap to another task and wait for an operating system interrupt before returning to the waiting task

3. **Better resource utilisation**
   - Processor is kept busy rather than idling during I/O operations

---

## Drawbacks of Concurrent Processing

1. **Longer completion times with high load**
   - When large numbers of users or processes are involved, individual processes can take longer to complete
   - Processes involving high quantities of computation take longer as each is allocated only a certain time slice
   - Processes cannot be completed at once, requiring multiple cycles

2. **Processing overhead**
   - There is an overhead in coordinating and switching between processes
   - Context switching (saving and loading process states) takes time
   - This overhead reduces overall program throughput

3. **Task suitability limitations**
   - Not all tasks are suited to being broken up and performed concurrently
   - Some tasks must be completed sequentially due to dependencies
   - Similar limitation exists for parallel processing

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Parallel Processing

### Advantages

1. **Speed improvements for repetitive calculations**
   - When performing repetitive calculations on large quantities of data (e.g., image or video editing), parallel processing speeds up performance by splitting processes over several processors

2. **Enhanced graphics processing**
   - Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) can render 3D objects quickly by splitting scene computations between multiple cores

3. **True multitasking**
   - Multiple different programs or browser web pages can run on different processors at the same time

### Disadvantages

1. **Communication overhead**
   - Different processors running programs simultaneously may need to communicate
   - This leads to overhead and delays in processing

2. **Optimisation issues**
   - Some tasks may run faster or be optimised to run on a single processor rather than multiple processors
   - Not all algorithms benefit from parallelisation

## Practical Applications

**Modern computing examples:**
- **Operating systems:** Running virus scan while user plays a game (concurrent processing)
- **Photo/video editing software:** Splitting image processing across multiple cores (parallel processing)
- **AAA games:** Using parallel computing to complete multiple tasks simultaneously for improved performance
- **Web browsers:** Running multiple tabs concurrently
- **Flight simulators:** Plane movements, weather conditions, and other aircraft operate independently with concurrent processing

## Exam Tips

1. **Concurrent vs parallel:** Always distinguish between concurrent processing (single processor, time slicing) and parallel processing (multiple processors, true simultaneity)

2. **Dependencies:** When asked about which tasks can be concurrent, identify tasks without dependencies that can run independently

3. **Context switching:** Remember that concurrent processing involves overhead from context switching, which can reduce efficiency

4. **Scheduling algorithms:** Note that some operating system scheduling algorithms can prioritise certain concurrent processes over others, potentially allowing larger processes to finish sooner

5. **Example structure:** When providing examples, state:
   - What the example is
   - How it acts concurrently
   - Why it is necessary for it to be concurrent
