## Secondary Storage Devices

Secondary storage devices retain digital data and are used to store user data like images, videos, and documents. There are three main types: **magnetic**, **optical**, and **flash**.

### Optical Storage

Optical devices are read from and written to using **lasers**. Binary information is represented by portions of the disc that either reflect or scatter incident laser light, written in spiral tracks on the disc's surface.

- **Pits** (recessed portions) scatter light → represent **0**
- **Lands** (flat portions) reflect light → represent **1**

| Device | Capacity | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| CD (Compact Disc) | ~700 MB | Used for audio files, text, and digital images. Varieties: CD-R (write once), CD-RW (rewritable), CD-ROM (read only) |
| DVD (Digital Versatile/Video Disc) | 4.7–9 GB | Higher capacity than CDs; suited for digital videos |
| Blu-ray | 25–50 GB | More than 5× DVD storage; used for high-resolution films |

**Advantages**: Portable (small, thin, light); durable against environmental conditions; easy to transport; low cost per disc.

**Disadvantages**: Easily damaged by scratches; limited storage capacity; relatively slow transfer speeds.

### Magnetic Storage

Magnetic storage represents binary information using two magnetic states: **polarised** and **unpolarised**.

- **Polarised**: Magnetic poles align → read by a read/write head → represents **1**
- **Unpolarised**: Magnetic poles randomly scattered → different reading → represents **0**

| Device | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Hard Disk Drive (HDD)** | Typically 500 GB–2 TB (consumer). Rotating magnetic platters under a read/write head on an actuating arm. Multiple platters stacked to maximise capacity. |
| **Magnetic Tape** | Historical medium (1950s–1980s). Wound onto reels, passed through readers. Sequential access only. Still used for archival backup. |
| **Floppy Disk** | Thin magnetic disk in plastic casing. Typical capacity ~1 MB (some up to 200 MB). Historically used like USB drives today. |

**HDD Advantages**: High storage capacity; relatively low cost per gigabyte; suitable for long-term storage and backup.

**HDD Disadvantages**: Slower read/write speeds compared to SSDs; susceptible to physical damage from movement; moving parts can wear out.

### Flash Storage

Flash storage uses **silicon semiconductors** forming **NAND** and **NOR** logic gates to store electrical charge in one of two states: **high** or **low** (representing 1 and 0).

- Data is stored in **blocks**, which combine to form **pages**
- **NOR gates**: Preferred for small data quantities (e.g., executable code)
- **NAND gates**: Preferred for larger files (photos, videos)

**Key characteristics**:
- Can be erased and reprogrammed **electronically**
- **Non-volatile**: Retains data when power is lost
- No moving parts → more resistant to physical damage
- Silent operation

| Device | Typical Capacity | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| **Solid State Drive (SSD)** | 120 GB–4 TB | Light, portable, high data transfer rates, no moving parts |
| **USB Flash Drive** | 8–256 GB | Very portable (small, lightweight), moderate durability |

**Advantages**: Fast read/write speeds; no moving parts (less likely to fail from physical shock); silent.

**Disadvantages**: Higher cost per gigabyte; flash memory cells wear out after a certain number of write cycles (limited lifespan due to increasing voltage requirements).

### Storage Comparison Table

| Factor | Magnetic (HDD) | Optical | Flash (SSD) |
|--------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| **Capacity** | High (500 GB–2 TB+) | Low–Medium (700 MB–50 GB) | Medium–High (120 GB–4 TB) |
| **Speed** | Moderate | Slow | Fast |
| **Cost per GB** | Low | Very Low | High |
| **Portability** | Low (internal) | High | High |
| **Durability** | Moderate (moving parts) | Low (scratches) | High (no moving parts) |
| **Volatility** | Non-volatile | Non-volatile | Non-volatile |

### Choosing the Right Storage Device

Consider:
- **Storage needs**: How much data? (HDD for large amounts, USB for few documents)
- **Performance needs**: Fast access required? (SSD for video editing, gaming)
- **Portability**: Need to transport data? (USB drives, external SSDs)
- **Cost**: Balance budget against storage and performance requirements

## RAM and ROM

RAM and ROM are types of **primary storage** used by the computer's operating system to run the computer. They store code instructions and files required by running programs.

### RAM (Random Access Memory)

- **Purpose**: Stores data currently being used by the computer (open applications, files)
- **Volatile**: Loses its contents when power is lost
- **Read/Write**: Data can be read from and written to by the processor
- **Directly accessible**: Processor can access any part equally fast ("random access")
- **Speed**: Faster access than secondary storage (even flash memory)
- **Cost**: More expensive per gigabyte than secondary storage
- **Typical capacity**: 4–8 GB (compared to hundreds/thousands GB of secondary storage)

RAM is crucial for system speed and performance. More RAM allows more data to be processed simultaneously.

### ROM (Read-Only Memory)

- **Purpose**: Stores the **BIOS** (Basic Input/Output System) or **firmware** used to start up the computer and initialise hardware components
- **Non-volatile**: Retains contents when power is lost
- **Read-only**: Once programmed, data cannot be modified (memory cells do not change)
- **Use case**: Stores fixed sequences like the **bootstrap routine** (startup instructions)

In mobile devices, ROM contains the **bootloader** that starts the device and loads the operating system.

### RAM vs ROM Comparison

| Feature | RAM | ROM |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **Purpose** | Stores currently used data (applications, files) | Stores BIOS/firmware for startup |
| **Volatility** | Volatile (loses data without power) | Non-volatile (retains data) |
| **Read/Write** | Read and write | Read only |
| **Modifiability** | Can be modified | Cannot be modified after programming |
| **Speed** | Very fast | Fast |
| **Typical use** | Temporary storage during operation | Permanent storage of boot instructions |

## Virtual Storage

**Virtual storage** (also called **cloud storage**) refers to storing information remotely so it can be accessed by any computer with access to the same system (e.g., over the Internet).

### Examples
- Cloud storage services: Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, iCloud
- Networked storage in offices and schools

### How It Works

1. Data is transmitted over the Internet to a **data centre**
2. The data centre uses servers to store data, which can be accessed and retrieved as needed
3. Servers are maintained by the cloud storage provider who ensures security, backup, and availability

Virtual storage is often an **abstraction of multiple drives** acting as one. Cloud data is physically stored on hundreds of HDDs or SSDs formatted to appear as a single storage system.

### Advantages

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Scalability** | Easy to increase storage capacity as needs grow |
| **Accessibility** | Data can be accessed from anywhere with an Internet connection |
| **Data protection** | Data redundancy protects against hardware failure |
| **Cost-effective** | Pay only for storage used; often cheaper than maintaining own infrastructure |

### Disadvantages

| Drawback | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Internet dependence** | Access can be slow or impossible with poor connection |
| **Security concerns** | Storing sensitive data off-site poses risks despite provider security |
| **Ongoing costs** | Subscription costs can accumulate over time |
| **Network speed limitations** | Transfer speeds limited by user's Internet connection |

### Exam Tip

**Do not confuse virtual storage with virtual memory:**
- **Virtual storage** = data stored virtually (on the cloud)
- **Virtual memory** = utilising secondary storage as RAM when physical RAM is fully used
