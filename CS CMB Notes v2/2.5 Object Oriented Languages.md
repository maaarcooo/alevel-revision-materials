# 2.5 Object Oriented Languages

## Classes

A **class** is a blueprint or template used to create objects in Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Classes provide a way to organise code in a modular, reusable manner.

### Key Characteristics

- Classes define **attributes** (variables) that describe the properties of objects
- Classes contain **methods** (functions/procedures) that define behaviours objects can perform
- **Class variables** are attributes defined within a class
- **Instance variables** are attributes belonging to specific objects created from a class

### Types of Classes

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Pre-built classes** | Already exist in programming languages (e.g., Java's `String`, `Date`, `Random`, `Scanner`) |
| **Custom classes** | Created by programmers to define new data types (e.g., an `Animal` class) |

### Terminology

- **Instantiation**: The process of creating an object from a class
- **Identifier**: The name used to refer to an object

---

## Objects

An **object** is a specific instance of a class that represents a real-world entity (e.g., teacher, car, phone). Each object has its own unique **state** (attribute values) and **behaviours** (methods).

### Constructor

A **constructor** is a special method within a class that is automatically called when an object is instantiated. Constructors:

- Define the initial values of instance variables
- Perform any necessary setup to prepare the object for use

### Example

```
class Person
    firstName
    surname
    dateOfBirth
    hobbies
```

Two objects of class Person:
- Person 1: firstName = "Bob", surname = "Jones", dateOfBirth = "06/10/1981", hobbies = "E Sports"
- Person 2: firstName = "Jess", surname = "Jones", dateOfBirth = "05/04/1980", hobbies = "Astronomy"

### Creating Objects (Instantiation Syntax)

```
objectName = new ClassName(parameters)
```
Example: `mushypeas = new ItemForSale("mushy peas", 0.89)`

---

## Methods

**Methods** are functions associated with objects or classes that define the behaviour and actions objects can perform.

### Types of Methods

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Function** | A method that **must return a value** |
| **Procedure** | A method that **does not need to return a value** |

### Calling Methods

Objects use **dot notation** to access methods from their class:
```
objectName.methodName()
```
Example: `jumboJet.Takeoff()`

### Instance Methods vs Static Methods

| Instance Methods | Static Methods |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Associated with individual instances (objects) of a class | Associated with the class itself |
| Operate on specific data and properties of an object | Can be called without creating an instance of the class |

### Public vs Private Methods

| Public Methods | Private Methods |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Accessible from any code within the same class or external classes | Only accessible within the same class |
| Can be invoked by external code | Cannot be invoked by external code or other classes |
| Changes may impact other parts of the codebase | Changes have localised impact only |
| Used for functionalities exposed to other parts of the program | Used for internal implementation details |

**Note**: If neither `public` nor `private` is specified, the default is `public`.

---

## Attributes

**Attributes** are data members or properties associated with an object or class. They define the **state** of an object and can have different values for different instances of the same class.

### Characteristics

- Can be of various data types: integers, strings, Booleans, or other objects
- Can have different **access rights** (public/private)
- **Class attributes**: Defined at class level
- **Instance attributes**: Belong to specific object instances

### Example

```
class Car
    private manufacturer: String
```
Object instance: Car1 with manufacturer = "Ford"

### Important Note

Attributes declared within methods (local variables) cannot have access modifiers because:
- They are local to the method with limited scope
- They are only accessible within the block/method where declared
- They are not part of the class's state

---

## Inheritance

**Inheritance** is a key OOP concept that allows a class to inherit the properties and behaviours (methods and attributes) of another class.

### Terminology

| Term | Alternative Names | Description |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Base class** | Parent class, Superclass | The blueprint from which derived classes inherit |
| **Derived class** | Child class, Subclass | Inherits characteristics from the base class |

### Key Concepts

- Establishes an **"IS-A" relationship** between classes (e.g., "a Car IS-A Vehicle")
- Promotes **code reuse** by avoiding duplication
- Derived classes can:
  - Access and use methods/attributes from the base class
  - Add additional attributes and methods
  - Override inherited methods

### The `super` Keyword

Used in inheritance to refer to the superclass and access its members (methods, attributes, or constructors) from within the subclass.

### Example Structure

```
Base Class: Vehicle
├── Attributes: Manufacturer, Make, Cost
├── Methods: TurnEngineOn(), TurnEngineOff(), SteerLeft(), SteerRight()
│
├── Derived Class: Car
│   ├── Additional Attributes: IsInsured, EngineCapacity
│   └── Additional Methods: GearChange(), UnlockDoors()
│
└── Derived Class: Truck
    ├── Additional Attributes: IsRefrigerated, TotalCargoArea
    └── Additional Methods: ReleaseTrailer(), UnlockTrailerDoors()
```

## Encapsulation

**Encapsulation** is the practice of grouping data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a class, while controlling access using access modifiers.

### Benefits

- **Security**: Data remains secure and cannot be accidentally modified or misused
- **Organisation**: Related data and methods are kept together within an object
- **Code reusability**: Objects/classes can be used in different parts of a program without rewriting code
- **Abstraction**: Hides implementation details, reducing complexity

### How Encapsulation Works

| Private Variables/Methods | Public Variables/Methods |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Only accessible within the class itself | Accessible from outside the class |
| External code cannot access directly | External code can interact through these |
| Provides data protection | Provides controlled interface |

### Encapsulation in Practice

```
public class Obstacle
    private moving      // Boolean - only accessible within class
    private distance    // Real number - only accessible within class
    private direction   // Integer - only accessible within class
    
    public procedure updateDistance(givenDistance)
        distance = givenDistance  // Public method to modify private attribute
    endprocedure
endclass
```

To modify the private `distance` attribute, external code must use the public `updateDistance()` method.

## Polymorphism

**Polymorphism** is a concept that allows objects to take on different forms or behaviours. Different objects can share the same method name but work in different ways.

### Benefits

- Makes code more **flexible**, **reusable**, and **easier to maintain**
- Objects can be treated as belonging to a common group even if they belong to different classes
- Code becomes more versatile and adaptable to changes

### Method Overloading

Multiple methods with the **same name** but **different implementations** in different classes.

Example:
```
Base Class: Animal
    method move() → prints "I am going to move somehow"

Derived Class: Fish
    OVERRIDE method move() → prints "I am a fish swimming"

Derived Class: Bear
    OVERRIDE method move() → prints "I am a bear lumbering around"
```

### Method Overriding

The **`override`** keyword provides a new implementation for a method already defined in the parent class.

Example:
```
Base Class: Vehicle
    method startEngine() → prints "Engine Started!"
    method displayInfo() → prints "I am a Vehicle!"

Derived Class: Motorcycle
    OVERRIDE method displayInfo() → prints "I am a Motorcycle!"

Derived Class: Car
    OVERRIDE method displayInfo() → prints "I am a Car!"
```

- Calling `startEngine()` on any derived object outputs "Engine Started!" (inherited)
- Calling `displayInfo()` executes the overridden method specific to that class

### Treating Objects as Common Groups

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass:

```
Vehicle vehicle1 = new Car()
Vehicle vehicle2 = new Motorcycle()
```

- An array of type `Vehicle` can store both `Motorcycle` and `Car` objects
- `vehicle1.displayInfo()` outputs "I am a Car!"
- `vehicle2.displayInfo()` outputs "I am a Motorcycle!"

## Exam Tips

1. **Method vs Function vs Procedure**: A method can be either a function (returns value) or procedure (no return value)
2. **Default access**: If `public`/`private` not specified, assume `public`
3. **Local variables**: Cannot have access modifiers as they have limited scope within their method
4. **Inheritance terminology**: Know all alternative names (base/parent/superclass, derived/child/subclass)
5. **Instantiation syntax**: Be able to write code to create objects with parameters
