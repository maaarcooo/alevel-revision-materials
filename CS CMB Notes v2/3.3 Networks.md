# 3.3 Networks

## Characteristics of a Network

A **network** is two or more computers connected together with the ability to **transmit data** between each other. The main purposes of a network are to enable **data sharing**, **resource sharing**, **communication**, and **collaboration**.

### Local Area Network (LAN)
- A network spread over a **small geographical area** or a **single site** (e.g., a school or office building)
- All hardware is typically **owned by a single organisation**
- More **secure** than WANs as connections are privately owned
- Built using **hubs and/or switches** connecting devices

**Advantages of LANs:**
- Centralised management of updates, backups, and software
- Enhanced security through firewalls and antivirus software
- File sharing and collaboration between users
- Shared resources (e.g., printers, peripherals)

**Disadvantages of LANs:**
- Hardware failure can affect the entire network
- More vulnerable to attacks than standalone computers
- Network traffic can slow data access
- Requires maintenance and ongoing costs

### Wide Area Network (WAN)
- A network spread over a **large geographical area** (e.g., across cities, countries, or continents)
- Connects multiple LANs together
- Usually requires extra **telecommunication hardware**
- Infrastructure is typically **owned by third parties** (ISPs, telecommunications companies)
- The **Internet** is the largest WAN, made up of a series of smaller networks
- Connected using **large international backbone cables**, many passing underwater

**Advantages of WANs:**
- Enables communication and data sharing between different locations
- Allows access to central servers and shared databases from anywhere

**Disadvantages of WANs:**
- Typically slower than LANs due to greater transmission distances
- More expensive to set up and maintain (leased lines, ISP costs)
- More vulnerable to security risks as data travels across public networks

## Importance of Protocols and Standards

### Protocols
A **protocol** is a **set of rules** defining how two computers **communicate** with each other. Protocols are **standardised** so that all devices have a designated method of communicating regardless of manufacturer.

**Common Internet Protocols:**

| Protocol | Full Name | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **HTTP** | Hypertext Transfer Protocol | Web page rendering and transferring web content |
| **HTTPS** | HTTP Secure | Encrypted version of HTTP for secure transactions |
| **TCP/IP** | Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol | Routing packets through networks |
| **FTP** | File Transfer Protocol | Transmission of files over networks |
| **SMTP** | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol | Sending email messages between servers |
| **POP3** | Post Office Protocol | Email retrieval (downloads emails to device) |
| **IMAP** | Internet Message Access Protocol | Email access (syncs across devices) |
| **ARP** | Address Resolution Protocol | Translates IP addresses into MAC addresses |
| **UDP** | User Datagram Protocol | Connectionless, faster transmission without guaranteed delivery |

### Standards
A **standard** is a set of guidelines or frameworks that govern how a task should be performed or how a product should function.

**Purpose of Standards:**
- Ensure **compatibility** and **interoperability** across different devices and software
- Enable devices from different manufacturers to work together seamlessly
- Ensure data can be correctly interpreted by receiving devices
- Support network expansion and integration of new technologies
- Foster innovation and competition

## The Internet Structure

The **Internet** is a **network of networks** which allows computers on opposite sides of the globe to communicate with each other.

### The TCP/IP Stack and Protocol Layering

**Protocol layering** divides network protocols into **layers**, each performing **specific functions**. This allows for **modular design**, simplifies troubleshooting, and promotes **interoperability**.

**Benefits of Layering:**
- **Modularity**: Easier to design, implement, and troubleshoot
- **Interoperability**: Different technologies work together seamlessly
- **Ease of Updates**: Changes to one layer don't affect others
- **Specialisation**: Each layer can be optimised for its specific function

**TCP/IP** (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) is a **stack of networking protocols** that work together, passing packets during communication.

#### The Four Layers (Top to Bottom):

**1. Application Layer**
- Located at the **top** of the stack
- Specifies which **protocol** needs to be used to relate to the application being sent
- Interacts directly with software applications (web browsers, email clients)
- Prepares data for transmission (**encapsulation**)
- Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3

**2. Transport Layer**
- Uses **TCP** to establish an **end-to-end connection** between source and recipient
- **Splits data into packets** and labels them with:
  - Packet number
  - Total number of packets
  - **Port number** for communication
- **Requests retransmission** of lost packets

**3. Internet Layer (Network Layer)**
- Adds **source and destination IP addresses** to packets
- The combination of IP address and port number is called a **socket address**
- **Routers** operate at this layer to forward packets using IP addresses
- Responsible for **routing** packets across the network

**4. Link Layer (Network Interface Layer)**
- Creates **connection between network devices**
- Adds **MAC addresses** identifying the Network Interface Cards of source and destination
- For devices on the same network: destination MAC = recipient's MAC
- For devices on different networks: destination MAC = router's MAC
- Translates digital packets into electrical, optical, or wireless signals

#### Data Flow:
- **Sending**: Data flows from Application → Transport → Internet → Link
- **Receiving**: Process is reversed; each layer removes its specific header and performs its tasks

### Domain Name System (DNS)

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is used to **name** and **organise internet resources**. It translates human-readable **domain names** into numeric **IP addresses**.

**Structure:**
- DNS is a **hierarchy** where smaller domains are separated from larger domains by a full stop
- Example: `leeds.gov.uk`
- **TLD** = Top Level Domain (e.g., .uk, .com, .org)
- **2LD** = 2nd Level Domain (e.g., gov in leeds.gov.uk)

**DNS Resolution Process:**
1. User enters URL into web browser
2. Computer checks **local cache** for stored IP address
3. If not found, browser sends query to **DNS resolver** (usually provided by ISP)
4. Resolver checks its cache; if not found, queries **DNS root servers**
5. Root server directs to appropriate **TLD server** (.com, .org, etc.)
6. TLD server provides IP of **authoritative DNS server**
7. Authoritative server returns the IP address
8. Browser sends HTTP/HTTPS request to the IP address
9. Server responds with web page data
10. Browser renders the page

**Benefits of DNS:**
- Users remember domain names instead of IP addresses
- Handles mapping automatically

## Network Communication

### Data Packets

**Packets** are **segments of data** containing various information:

**Header:**
- **Sender and recipient IP addresses** (like postcodes for delivery)
- **Protocol** being used (tells recipient how to interpret the packet)
- **Order/sequence number** of packets (for reconstruction)
- **Time To Live (TTL) / Hop Limit** (tells packet when to expire)

**Payload:**
- **Raw data** to be transmitted

**Trailer:**
- **Checksum** or **cyclic redundancy check** (CRC) for error detection

### Packet Switching

**Packet switching** is a method of communication where data is split into **packets** and sent across the network. Each packet can take a **different route** to the destination and is reassembled upon arrival.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Multiple methods ensure data integrity (checksums, CRC) | Time spent deconstructing and reconstructing packets |
| Multiple routes available; if one fails, another can be used | Must wait for all packets before data is complete |
| Efficient use of network resources (bandwidth shared) | Packets can arrive out of order |
| More reliable—only lost packets need retransmission | Not ideal for real-time services (video calls, VoIP) |
| Highly scalable for large networks | Network congestion can cause packet loss |

### Circuit Switching

**Circuit switching** creates a **dedicated direct link** between two devices for the **entire duration** of the conversation. Both devices must transfer and receive data at the **same rate**.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Data arrives in logical order (quicker reconstruction) | **Bandwidth is wasted** when no data is being sent |
| No delays as dedicated path is established | Devices must transfer at the same rate |
| Ideal for real-time services (phone calls) | More costly due to dedicated line requirement |
| Data follows the same path | Electrical interference can corrupt data |
| | Ties up network sections until transmission completes |
| | Less flexible and scalable |

## Client-Server and Peer-to-Peer Networks

### Client-Server

A network where **terminals (clients)** connect to a **powerful, central server**. The server holds important information and resources, with greater processing power than clients. Clients **request** services from the server.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| More **secure** (data stored in one location) | **Expensive** to set up |
| **Central backups** (no individual backups needed) | Functionality depends on server (single point of failure) |
| Data and resources **shared** between clients | Requires **trained staff** to maintain |
| Easier central management | |
| Scalable (new clients easily added) | |

**Use case:** Larger organisations requiring centralised control, reliability, and security

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

A network where computers are connected to share files directly. Each device acts as **both server and client**, able to **provide and request** resources. All machines have **equal status**.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| **Cheaper** to set up | **Impossible to trace** origin of files |
| Allows resource sharing | **Backups** must be performed separately |
| **Easy to maintain** | **Poorer security** |
| **Not dependent** on a central server | May be difficult to **locate resources** |
| Specialist staff **not required** | Not suitable for large networks (performance issues) |
| No single point of failure | Lack of central control |

**Use cases:** Home networks, small businesses, file sharing applications

## Exam Tips

1. **Packet vs Circuit Switching**: Don't discuss "speed" of transmission—focus on **bandwidth efficiency**, **bit rates**, or **reliability** instead.

2. **TCP/IP Layers**: Remember the order using mnemonics (e.g., "All Teachers In London" = Application, Transport, Internet, Link).

3. **Dropped vs Rejected packets**: Dropped = silent discard; Rejected = sender notified.

4. **Hub vs Switch**: Hubs broadcast to all; switches use lookup tables to send to specific devices only.

5. **Client-Server vs P2P**: Consider security, cost, scalability, and central management requirements when comparing.

6. **DNS Process**: Questions often ask you to explain the full resolution process—remember the hierarchy (resolver → root → TLD → authoritative).
