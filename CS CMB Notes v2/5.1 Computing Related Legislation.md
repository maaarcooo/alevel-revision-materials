## The Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA)

### What It Covers

The DPA is a law that **protects personal data from being misused**. It applies to information stored both on **computers** and in **organised paper filing systems**.

**Personal data** is any data which can be used to identify a **living person**, including data that can be used **in combination with other data** to identify someone.

Examples of personal data: name, address, date of birth, race, religion.

A **data subject** is an individual who can be identified by personal data.

### The Eight Data Protection Principles

| Principle | Explanation | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| 1. Personal data must be **fairly and lawfully processed** | Companies must be clear about what data they collect and why | A school requests data to contact guardians in emergencies |
| 2. Personal data must be obtained for **specified and lawful purposes** | Data cannot be used for purposes other than originally stated; cannot be passed on without permission | A company asks for a phone number for delivery but uses it for marketing |
| 3. Personal data must be **adequate, relevant and not excessive** | Cannot request data not immediately needed | A bank cannot ask for travel history when opening an account |
| 4. Personal data must be **accurate and up to date** | Data subjects have the right to have incorrect data corrected or deleted | A bank with an old address cannot send current statements |
| 5. Personal data must **not be kept longer than necessary** | Data must be deleted when no longer needed | When a customer closes their account, their data must be deleted |
| 6. Personal data must be processed **in accordance with data subjects' rights** | On request, companies must provide all personal data held | A hospital must provide a patient's full records if requested |
| 7. Personal data must be **held securely** | Appropriate technical and organisational measures must be taken against unauthorised access, loss or damage | Using usernames/passwords, making cloud backups |
| 8. Personal data must **not be transferred outside the EEA** unless adequate protection exists | Cannot send data to countries without adequate data protection laws | Cannot transfer data to countries not deemed to have adequate protection |

### Exemptions to the DPA

Not all data processing is subject to the DPA:

- **Domestic purposes** – personal use such as writing to friends/family or taking personal photos
- **Law enforcement** – police investigating crimes are not subject to the DPA
- **Intelligence services processing** – data processed by MI5 etc. is not covered

### Rights of Individuals Under the DPA

Data subjects have the right to:

- Be **informed** about the collection and use of their personal data
- **Access** personal data and supplementary information
- Have **inaccurate data rectified** or completed if incomplete
- Be **forgotten** in certain circumstances
- **Restrict processing** in certain circumstances
- **Data portability** – obtain and reuse personal data across different services
- **Object to processing** in certain circumstances
- Challenge **automated decision making and profiling**
- **Withdraw consent** at any time
- **Complain** to the Information Commissioner

### Actions Companies Must Take

- Face **large fines** for breaches
- Appoint a **Data Controller** responsible for compliance and communication with the **Information Commissioner**
- Implement **physical and digital security measures**
- **Train staff** to abide by the principles
- Respond to **Subject Access Requests (SAR)** by sending a secure copy of data after verifying identity

### Update: GDPR and DPA 2018

As of 2018, the Data Protection Act 1998 has been replaced by the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and the **Data Protection Act 2018**.

## The Computer Misuse Act 1990 (CMA)

### What It Covers

The CMA concerns the **malicious use of computers**. It was originally created to ensure that **computer hacking was covered by law** and has been **frequently updated** to remain relevant.

### The Three Primary Offences

| Offence | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 1. **Unauthorised access** to computer materials | Simply accessing a system without permission | Finding a teacher's password and opening their files |
| 2. **Unauthorised access with intent** to commit further offences | Accessing with intention to commit additional crimes | Finding a teacher's password and accessing files with intent to change marks |
| 3. **Unauthorised modification** of computer material | Actually making changes to data/systems | Finding a teacher's password and increasing your mark on the markbook |

### Consequences

- Each offence is **punishable with imprisonment**
- Consequences become **progressively worse** from offence 1 to 3
- Offence 2 and 3 carry more severe penalties than offence 1

### Preventive Measures

- **Digital signatures** or certificates to verify identity
- **Firewalls** to prevent external access and DoS/DDoS attacks
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access controls
- Security monitoring
- Regular penetration testing

## The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA)

### What It Covers

This act protects **intellectual property** of individuals and companies. It makes it **illegal to copy, modify or distribute** software or other intellectual property without permission.

### Key Features

- Covers everything from logos to music recordings to videos
- If work is **original**, copyright **automatically applies**
- Copyright expires **25-70 years after the death of the creator**, depending on the type of work
- In **1992**, the Act was extended to include **computer programs as a type of literary work**, meaning copyright **automatically applies to code**
- If an individual believes their work has been copied, it is **their responsibility to take action**

### Primary Breaches

- **Copying** an original work
- **Issuing** copies to the public
- **Renting/lending** copies to the public
- **Performing, showing or playing** the work in public
- Making an **adaptation** of the original work

### Secondary Breaches

- **Importing** a copy of original work
- **Possessing or dealing** with a copy
- **Providing means** to make copies
- **Permitting use of premises** for making copies
- Providing **props/equipment for a performance** of a copied work

### Relevance to Computing

- Protects **software/videos** from illegal distribution
- Many sites offer free downloads of copyrighted material, preventing copyright holders from earning income
- Covers **peer-to-peer streaming** which prevents copyright owners from receiving income

## The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA)

### What It Covers

RIPA legislates **how organisations can monitor electronic communications**. It covers **investigation, surveillance and interception of communication** by **public bodies**.

### Key Provisions

- Intelligence services (e.g., MI6) can legally **wiretap online conversations** in the interests of national security, provided a **warrant has been issued**
- Certain actions require **government approval**
- Different organisations have **different limits** on their powers (GCHQ has most freedom)
- **ISPs and mobile phone companies** must:
  - Give up information upon request from an authorised authority
  - Ensure their networks have **sufficient hardware to facilitate surveillance**

### Powers Granted Under RIPA

Public bodies (Police and others) can:

- Demand ISPs provide access to a customer's communications
- Conduct **mass surveillance** of communications
- Demand access to **protected information**
- Monitor an individual's **internet activities**
- **Prevent interception activities being revealed in court**

### Impact on Organisations

- ISPs must implement **hardware and software to facilitate surveillance**
- Businesses must provide access to digital communications when asked
- Must implement solutions for **storage of digital communications**

### Controversies

- Powers extend to **small agencies like local councils**
- Some consider it an **invasion of privacy**
- Often **improperly used** for non-criminal/non-terrorist purposes
- Examples of misuse: monitoring cockle fishermen, fly tippers, families checking school catchment areas

## Exam Tips

### Data Protection Act
- **Explain** principles, don't just state them
- OCR accepts answers using GDPR interpretation as the law has changed since the specification was set

### Computer Misuse Act
- Relate the law to the **specific scenario** in the question
- Consider how the CMA affects the company and consequences of actions taken

### Copyright, Designs and Patents Act
- Always use the **full name** of the act (not "Copyright Act")
- Specify that it covers **original work** and is **automatically applied**
- Explain implications for distribution

### Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act
- Use technical terms: **"surveillance"** and **"communication"**
- Surveillance = use of technology to gather information on people
- Communication = done electronically
