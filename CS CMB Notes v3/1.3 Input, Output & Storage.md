## Input Devices

An **input device** is hardware that allows users to enter data or commands into a computer system.

| Device | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Keyboard** | Enters text and commands by pressing keys |
| **Mouse** | Navigates the screen, clicks items, performs functions |
| **Touchscreen** | Allows interaction by touching the screen directly |
| **Microphone** | Captures audio input for voice commands or recording |
| **Webcam** | Captures video/images for conferencing or recording |
| **Scanner** | Digitises physical documents or images |
| **Barcode reader** | Reads information from printed barcodes (retail, access control) |
| **Magnetic stripe reader** | Reads data from magnetic stripes on cards (credit/debit cards) |
| **Graphics tablet** | Allows drawing/sketching directly onto a computer |
| **Biometric devices** | Fingerprint scanners, facial recognition for identity verification |
| **Game controller/Joystick** | Controls game characters and movement |

## Output Devices

An **output device** is hardware that presents processed information from the computer to the user.

| Device | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Monitor** | Displays visual output (text, images, video) |
| **Printer** | Produces hard copies of digital documents/images |
| **Speakers/Headphones** | Output audio (music, sound effects, voice) |
| **Projector** | Projects display onto a large screen or wall |
| **Braille display** | Outputs information in Braille for visually impaired users |
| **Plotter** | Prints large, high-quality diagrams (engineering, architecture) |
| **VR headset** | Provides immersive visual and audio output |
| **Computer-controlled machinery** | Receives commands to control robotic/manufacturing operations |

**Dual input/output devices**: A **touchscreen** functions as both input (touch detection) and output (visual display).

## Choosing Devices

When selecting input/output devices, consider:

- **User needs**: What tasks will be performed?
- **User skills**: Is the device intuitive for the user?
- **Environment**: Physical setting and security requirements
- **Cost**: Budget vs. required features
- **Speed and accuracy**: Data transfer rates and precision of input
- **Relevance**: Is this the right device for the task?

## Secondary Storage Types

### Optical Storage

**Optical devices** use **lasers** to read and write data. Binary information is represented by portions of the disc that either **reflect** or **scatter** laser light.

- **Pits**: Recessed portions that scatter light → represent **0**
- **Lands**: Flat portions that reflect light → represent **1**
- Data is written in **spiral tracks** on the disc surface

| Device | Capacity | Use |
|--------|----------|-----|
| **CD** (Compact Disc) | ~700 MB | Audio files, text, images |
| **DVD** (Digital Versatile/Video Disc) | 4.7–9 GB | Digital video, larger files |
| **Blu-ray** | 25–50 GB | High-resolution films |

**CD variants**:
- **CD-R**: Write once only
- **CD-RW**: Rewritable multiple times
- **CD-ROM**: Written during production, read-only thereafter

**Advantages**: Portable (small, thin, light), low cost per disc, durable against environmental conditions

**Disadvantages**: Easily scratched, limited capacity, slow transfer speeds

### Magnetic Storage

**Magnetic storage** represents binary using **two magnetic states**: polarised and unpolarised.
- **Polarised**: Magnetic poles aligned → can be read by read/write head
- **Unpolarised**: Poles randomly scattered → produces different reading

**Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**:
- Rotating **magnetic platters** spin at high speed under a **read/write head** on an **actuating arm**
- Multiple platters stacked to maximise capacity
- Typical capacity: **500 GB – 2+ TB** (consumer grade)
- **Advantages**: High capacity, low cost per GB, suitable for long-term storage
- **Disadvantages**: Slow data transfer, susceptible to physical damage (moving parts), delicate

**Magnetic Tape**:
- Long tape wound on reels, passed through readers checking polarity
- Historically popular (1950s–1980s), bulky storage method
- Superseded by more modern technologies
- Still used for archival/backup in enterprise environments

**Floppy Disks**:
- Thin magnetic disk enclosed in plastic casing
- Typical capacity: ~1 MB (later versions up to 200 MB)
- Portable, used for exchanging small data amounts
- Now obsolete, replaced by USB flash drives

### Flash Storage

**Flash storage** uses **silicon semiconductors** forming **NAND** and **NOR** logic gates to store electrical charge in two states: **high** or **low** (representing 1 and 0).

- Information stored in **blocks**, combined to form **pages**
- **NOR flash**: Preferred for small data quantities (e.g., executable code)
- **NAND flash**: Preferred for larger files (photos, videos)

**Characteristics**:
- **Electronically erasable** and reprogrammable
- **Non-volatile**: Retains data without power
- **No moving parts**: More durable than HDDs
- Fast read/write speeds
- Silent operation

**Solid State Drive (SSD)**:
- Light, portable, no moving parts
- **High data transfer rates**
- Resistant to physical shock
- **Disadvantages**: Higher cost per GB, limited lifespan (voltage required to write increases with each write cycle until the page becomes unwritable)

**USB Flash Drive**:
- Very portable (small, lightweight)
- Typical capacity: 8–256 GB
- Moderate cost per GB

**Cost comparison**: Flash memory is generally **more expensive per gigabyte** than magnetic or optical storage.

## Storage Comparison Table

| Device | Type | Capacity | Cost | Portability | Durability |
|--------|------|----------|------|-------------|------------|
| HDD | Magnetic | 500 GB – 2+ TB | Low per GB | Low | Moderate |
| SSD | Flash | 120 GB – 4 TB | High per GB | High | High |
| USB Flash | Flash | 8–256 GB | Moderate per GB | Very high | Moderate |
| CD/DVD/Blu-ray | Optical | 700 MB – 50 GB | Low per disc | High | Low |

## Choosing Storage Devices

Consider:
- **Storage needs**: How much data must be stored?
- **Performance needs**: Is fast data access required?
- **Portability**: Does data need to be transported?
- **Cost**: Budget constraints vs. capacity/speed requirements

## RAM and ROM

**RAM** and **ROM** are types of **primary storage** used by the operating system to run the computer.

### RAM (Random Access Memory)

- Stores data and programs **currently in use**
- **Volatile**: Loses contents when power is lost
- **Directly accessible**: Processor can access any part equally fast
- **Read and write**: Data can be modified
- **Faster** than secondary storage (including flash)
- **More expensive per GB** than secondary storage
- Typical capacity: 4–8 GB (much less than secondary storage)
- More RAM = more simultaneous data processing = faster performance

### ROM (Read-Only Memory)

- Stores **BIOS/firmware** used to start the computer and initialise hardware (bootstrap routine)
- **Non-volatile**: Retains contents without power
- **Read-only**: Cannot be modified after programming
- Essential for system startup in all computer types

### RAM vs ROM Comparison

| Feature | RAM | ROM |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **Purpose** | Stores currently used data/programs | Stores BIOS/firmware for startup |
| **Volatility** | Volatile (loses data without power) | Non-volatile (retains data) |
| **Read/Write** | Read and write | Read-only |
| **Modifiability** | Contents change constantly | Fixed after programming |

## Virtual Storage

**Virtual storage** (cloud storage) stores information **remotely** on servers accessed over the Internet.

- Data transmitted to **data centres** with servers maintained by providers
- Appears local but is physically distributed across multiple servers and locations
- Examples: Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, networked storage (offices/schools)
- Often an **abstraction of multiple drives** acting as one unified storage system

### Benefits

- **Scalability**: Easy to increase capacity as needs grow
- **Accessibility**: Access data from anywhere with internet connection
- **Data protection**: Redundancy protects against hardware failure
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for storage used; no local infrastructure maintenance

### Drawbacks

- **Internet dependence**: Slow or no access with poor connection
- **Security concerns**: Sensitive data stored off-site poses risks
- **Ongoing costs**: Subscription expenses accumulate over time
- **Network speed limitations**: Transfer rates depend on connection quality

**Important distinction**: **Virtual storage** (cloud-based data storage) is different from **virtual memory** (using secondary storage as an extension of RAM when RAM is full).
