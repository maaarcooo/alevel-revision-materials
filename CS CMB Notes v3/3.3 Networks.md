# 3.3 Networks

## Networks and Protocols

### What is a Network?

A **network** is two or more computers connected together with the ability to transmit data between each other. Networks enable **data sharing**, **resource sharing**, **communication**, and **collaboration**.

### Types of Networks

**Local Area Network (LAN)**:
- Spread over a **small geographical area** or single site (e.g., a school)
- All hardware is typically **owned by a single organisation**
- More **secure** than WANs because connections are privately owned
- Built using **hubs** and/or **switches** connecting devices

**Wide Area Network (WAN)**:
- Spread over a **large geographical area** (e.g., multiple cities/countries)
- Requires **extra telecommunication hardware**
- Infrastructure typically **owned by third parties** (ISPs, telecom companies)
- The **Internet** is the largest WAN — a network of networks

### Protocols

A **protocol** is a **set of rules** defining how two computers communicate with each other.

**Purpose of protocols**:
- Ensure all devices have a **designated method of communicating** regardless of manufacturer
- Enable **successful and secure data transmission**
- Maintain **order and efficiency** in communications

**Common protocols**:

| Protocol | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **HTTP/HTTPS** | Web page transfer; HTTPS adds encryption for security |
| **TCP/IP** | Networking protocol for routing packets through networks |
| **FTP** | File transfer between hosts |
| **SMTP** | Sending email messages between servers |
| **POP3/IMAP** | Email retrieval protocols |
| **ARP** | Translates IP addresses to MAC addresses |
| **UDP** | Connectionless protocol; faster but no delivery guarantee |

### Standards

A **standard** is a set of guidelines or frameworks governing how tasks should be performed or products should function.

**Purpose of standards**:
- Ensure **compatibility** and **interoperability** across different devices and software
- Enable devices from **different manufacturers** to work together seamlessly
- Support **network expansion** and integration of new technologies
- Foster **innovation and competition** by providing common ground

## The TCP/IP Stack

### Protocol Layering

**Protocol layering** divides network protocols into layers, each performing specific functions.

**Benefits of layering**:
- **Modularity**: Easier to design, implement, and troubleshoot
- **Interoperability**: Different technologies work together seamlessly
- **Ease of updates**: Changes to one layer don't affect others
- **Specialisation**: Each layer focuses on its specific functions

### The Four-Layer TCP/IP Model

**TCP/IP** (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a stack of networking protocols that work together during communication.

#### 1. Application Layer (Top)
- Interacts directly with **software applications** (browsers, email clients)
- Specifies which **protocol** to use based on the application type
- Prepares data for transmission (**encapsulation**)
- Example protocols: HTTP, FTP, POP3, SMTP

#### 2. Transport Layer
- Establishes **end-to-end connection** between source and destination
- **Splits data into packets** and labels them with:
  - **Packet number** (sequence number)
  - **Total number of packets**
  - **Port number** for communication
- Requests **retransmission of lost packets**
- Protocols: TCP (reliable), UDP (faster, unreliable)

#### 3. Internet Layer (Network Layer)
- Adds **source and destination IP addresses** to packets
- The combination of IP address + port number = **socket address**
- **Routers** operate at this layer, using IP addresses to forward packets
- Responsible for **routing packets** across networks

#### 4. Link Layer (Network Interface Layer)
- Creates **physical connection** between network devices
- Adds **MAC addresses** of source and destination NICs
- Translates digital packets into **electrical, optical, or wireless signals**
- For same network: destination MAC = recipient's MAC
- For different networks: destination MAC = router's MAC

### Data Flow Through the Stack

**Sending**:
1. Application layer selects protocol and prepares data
2. Transport layer splits into packets, adds port numbers
3. Internet layer adds IP addresses
4. Link layer adds MAC addresses and transmits

**Receiving** (reverse order):
1. Link layer removes MAC addresses
2. Internet layer removes IP addresses
3. Transport layer reassembles packets using sequence numbers
4. Application layer presents data in requested format

## Domain Name System (DNS)

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** translates human-readable **domain names** into numeric **IP addresses**.

### Why DNS?
- Domain names are **easier to remember** than IP addresses
- Without DNS, users would need to memorise IP addresses for every website

### DNS Hierarchy
- Organised as a **hierarchy** with domains separated by full stops
- Example: `leeds.gov.uk`
  - **TLD** (Top Level Domain): `.uk`
  - **2LD** (Second Level Domain): `.gov`

### DNS Lookup Process

1. **URL Entry**: User enters URL in browser
2. **Local Cache Check**: Computer checks local cache for IP address
3. **DNS Query**: Browser sends query to **DNS resolver** (usually ISP-provided)
4. **Resolver Cache Check**: Resolver checks its cache
5. **Root Server Query**: If not cached, resolver asks **root servers** for TLD location
6. **TLD Server Query**: Root server directs to **TLD server** (e.g., .com, .org)
7. **Authoritative Server Query**: TLD server provides IP of **authoritative DNS server**
8. **IP Retrieval**: Authoritative server returns the domain's IP address
9. **Web Request**: Browser sends HTTP/HTTPS request to IP address
10. **Response**: Server sends webpage data back to browser

## Packet and Circuit Switching

### Data Packets

**Packets** are segments of data containing:

**Header**:
- **Source IP address** — identifies sender
- **Destination IP address** — identifies recipient
- **Protocol** — tells recipient how to interpret packet
- **Sequence number** — enables correct reassembly order
- **Time To Live (TTL)** / Hop Limit — prevents infinite circulation

**Payload**:
- The actual **raw data** being transmitted

**Trailer**:
- **Checksum** / **cyclic redundancy check (CRC)** — detects transmission errors

### Packet Switching

Data is **broken into packets** sent independently across the network, potentially via **different routes**, then **reassembled** at destination.

**Advantages**:
- **Efficient** use of network resources (bandwidth shared)
- **Resilient** — if one path fails, packets take alternative routes
- Only **lost packets** need retransmission, not entire data
- Enables **global communication** across large networks

**Disadvantages**:
- Time spent **deconstructing and reconstructing** packets
- Must **wait for all packets** before data is complete
- Packets may arrive **out of order**, requiring reassembly
- **Not ideal for real-time** services (video calls, VoIP)
- Potential for **network congestion**

### Circuit Switching

A **dedicated communication path** is established between two devices for the **entire duration** of communication.

**Advantages**:
- Data arrives in **logical order** — quicker reconstruction
- Enables **real-time communication** without delay (phone calls)
- **Constant, steady data transmission rate**

**Disadvantages**:
- **Bandwidth wasted** when no data is being sent
- Devices must transfer at the **same rate**
- **Electrical interference** can corrupt/destroy data
- **Ties up network sections** — unavailable to others until complete
- **Less flexible** and scalable
- **More expensive** due to dedicated line requirement
