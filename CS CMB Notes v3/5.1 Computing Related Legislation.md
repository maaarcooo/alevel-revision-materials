# 5.1 Computing Related Legislation

## The Data Protection Act 1998

The **Data Protection Act (DPA)** protects **personal data** from being misused. It applies to information stored on computers and in organised paper filing systems.

**Personal data** is any data that can be used to identify a **living person**, either directly or when combined with other data. Examples include name, address, date of birth, race, and religion.

A **data subject** is an individual who can be identified by personal data.

### The Eight Data Protection Principles

1. **Fairly and lawfully processed** — Companies must be clear about what personal data they collect and how it will be used
2. **Collected for specified and lawful purposes** — Data cannot be used for purposes other than originally stated, and cannot be passed on without permission
3. **Adequate, relevant and not excessive** — Only data that is actually needed should be collected
4. **Accurate and kept up to date** — Individuals have the right to have incorrect or outdated data corrected or deleted
5. **Not kept longer than necessary** — Data must be deleted once no longer needed
6. **Processed in accordance with data subjects' rights** — Individuals can request copies of all personal data held about them
7. **Held securely** — Appropriate technical and organisational security measures must be in place to prevent unauthorised access, accidental loss, or damage
8. **Not transferred outside the EEA** — Personal data cannot be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area unless that country has adequate data protection laws

### Rights of Data Subjects

- To be informed about collection and use of their personal data
- To access personal data held about them
- To have inaccurate data corrected or incomplete data completed
- To be forgotten (erasure) in certain circumstances
- To restrict processing in certain circumstances
- To data portability (obtain and reuse their data across different services)
- To object to processing in certain circumstances
- Rights relating to automated decision making and profiling
- To withdraw consent at any time
- To complain to the Information Commissioner

### Exemptions

- **Domestic purposes** — Personal data used for personal activities (e.g., writing to friends, taking personal photos)
- **Law enforcement** — Police investigating crimes are not subject to DPA
- **Intelligence services** — Personal data processed by services like MI5 is not covered

### Actions Companies Must Take

- Appoint a **Data Controller** responsible for ensuring compliance and communicating with the **Information Commissioner**
- Implement physical and digital security measures
- Train staff on the principles
- Respond to **Subject Access Requests (SAR)** by securely sending copies of data after verifying the subject's identity

Companies can face extremely large fines for breaches (e.g., British Airways fined £20 million in 2020).

**Note:** As of 2018, the DPA 1998 has been replaced by the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and the **Data Protection Act 2018**.

## The Computer Misuse Act 1990

The **Computer Misuse Act (CMA)** concerns the **malicious use of computers**. Originally created to ensure **computer hacking** was covered by law, it has been frequently updated to remain relevant.

### Three Primary Offences

1. **Unauthorised access to computer materials**
   - Example: Finding a teacher's password and opening their files
   
2. **Unauthorised access with intent to commit further offences**
   - Example: Finding a teacher's password and opening files with the intention of changing marks
   
3. **Unauthorised modification of computer material**
   - Example: Finding a teacher's password, opening files, and actually changing marks

Consequences escalate with each offence, with all being punishable by **imprisonment**.

### Security Measures to Minimise Threats

- **Digital signatures** or **certificates** to verify identity
- **Firewalls** to prevent external access and protect against **DoS** or **DDoS** attacks
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access controls
- Security monitoring
- Regular penetration testing

## The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988

This Act protects **intellectual property** of individuals and companies. It covers everything from logos to music recordings.

### Key Points

- If a work is **original**, **copyright automatically applies**
- Copyright does not expire until **25-70 years after the death of the creator**, depending on the type of work
- In 1992, the Act was extended to include **computer programs** as a type of literary work, meaning copyright automatically applies to code
- If an individual believes their work has been copied, it is **their responsibility** to take action under the Act

### Primary Breaches

- Copying an original work
- Issuing copies to the public
- Renting/lending copies to the public
- Performing, showing or playing the work in public
- Making an adaptation of the original work

### Secondary Breaches

- Importing a copy of original work
- Possessing or dealing with a copy
- Providing means to make copies
- Permitting use of premises for making copies
- Providing equipment for performance of a copy

**Peer-to-peer streaming** of videos and audio prevents copyright owners from earning income from their work and constitutes a breach of the Act.

## The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000

The **Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA)** legislates how organisations can monitor electronic communications. It covers **investigation**, **surveillance**, and **interception of communication** by **public bodies**.

### Key Provisions

- Intelligence services (e.g., MI6) can legally wiretap online conversations in the interests of **national security**, provided a **warrant** has been issued
- Certain actions require government approval
- Different organisations have different limits (GCHQ has the most freedom)
- **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** and **mobile phone companies** must:
  - Give up information on request from an authorised authority
  - Ensure networks have sufficient hardware installed to facilitate surveillance

### Powers Granted

- Demand ISPs provide access to customers' communications
- Allow mass surveillance of communications
- Demand access to protected information
- Monitor individuals' internet activities
- Prevent interception activities being revealed in court

### Controversies

- Powers extend to small agencies like **local councils**
- Some consider it an **invasion of privacy**
- Concerns about **improper use** — examples include councils using powers to monitor dog walkers, people feeding pigeons, fly-tippers, and families suspected of lying about school catchment areas
- In 2016, an investigation found 186 local authorities had carried out over 55,000 days of covert surveillance over 5 years
