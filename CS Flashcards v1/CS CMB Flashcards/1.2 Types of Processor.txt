What is the aim of CISC processors? | To accomplish tasks in as few lines of assembly code as possible
Where are CISC processors commonly used today? | In microcontrollers and embedded systems
Which processor type requires the compiler to do more work? | RISC processors
Which processor type requires more RAM to store code? | RISC processors (because code is longer)
Which processor type is suitable for pipelining? | RISC processors (because each instruction takes one clock cycle)
Which processor type has many specialised instructions that are rarely used? | CISC processors
What is a GPU? | Graphics Processing Unit - a device with many independent processors that work in parallel
What type of processor is a GPU classified as? | A co-processor (secondary processor that supplements the primary processor)
What tasks are GPUs particularly efficient at? | Repetitive tasks such as image processing and machine learning
Name three uses of GPUs besides graphics processing. | 3D modelling, data mining, machine learning, financial modelling, data modelling (any three)
Why are GPUs good for matrix operations? | They can perform calculations on multiple data simultaneously in parallel
What does SIMD stand for? | Single Instruction Multiple Data
What is SIMD processing? | When multiple processing elements perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously
What is a multicore CPU? | A CPU with multiple independent cores that can complete instructions separately
What is parallel processing? | When a computer has multiple cores that can work on tasks simultaneously
How do parallel systems differ from multicore systems? | Parallel systems can complete tasks with a single core using threading, while multicore systems use multiple cores
Which performs better in larger projects: multicore or parallel systems? | Multicore systems generally perform better in larger projects
What is one speed-related benefit of parallel processing? | If a task can be divided into subtasks executed simultaneously, total execution time can be reduced
What is one limitation of parallel processing speed? | There is a limit to maximum speed improvement if part of the program cannot be parallelised
Why is programming for parallel processing more complex? | Tasks must be synchronised and data shared correctly
Why is debugging parallel programs more difficult? | Due to the precise timing of specific events
What is a communication-related limitation of parallel processing? | Communication between processors can take significant time and resources, potentially outweighing benefits
Name one benefit of multicore processors for multitasking. | Each core can work on a different task, particularly effective when multiple applications are open
How do multicore processors handle background tasks better? | Background tasks can be assigned to one core, reducing impact on other tasks
How many transistors do RISC processors have compared to CISC? | RISC has fewer transistors than CISC
Which processor type requires less power? | RISC processors
Which processor type costs less to manufacture? | RISC processors
Which processor type takes up less space in memory? | CISC processors (instructions are shorter)
Which devices typically use RISC processors? | Smartphones and tablets
Which devices typically use CISC processors? | Laptops and desktop computers
How many addressing modes does RISC have compared to CISC? | RISC has fewer addressing modes than CISC
How many general purpose registers does RISC have compared to CISC? | RISC has fewer general purpose registers than CISC
Can a program written for a RISC processor run on a CISC processor? | No, they are incompatible
Can a program written for one RISC processor necessarily run on another RISC processor? | No, they may have different instruction sets
What are the three main characteristics that make GPUs suited for certain tasks? | Specialist instructions, multiple cores, and SIMD processing
Why are GPU cores different from CPU cores? | GPU cores are smaller but optimised for parallel processing, while CPU cores are optimised for serial processing
What are specialist instructions in GPUs designed for? | Operations on matrices, vectors, and geometric transformations common in 3D graphics rendering
What is one benefit of GPU parallel processing? | GPUs can handle many tasks simultaneously as they are multicore processors
What is one efficiency benefit of GPUs? | GPUs can perform more calculations per unit of power consumed compared to CPUs
Can you use only a GPU without a CPU? | No, the CPU assigns tasks to the GPU
What happens if a program becomes unresponsive on a multicore processor? | It won't slow the computer down as much because other cores continue running their tasks
