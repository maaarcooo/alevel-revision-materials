How does flash storage work? | Uses silicon semiconductors forming NAND and NOR logic gates to store electrical charge in high or low states.
How is information organised in flash storage? | In blocks, which are combined to form pages.
Which logic gate is preferred for storing small amounts of data in flash? | NOR.
Which logic gate is preferred for larger files in flash storage? | NAND.
Is flash memory volatile or non-volatile? | Non-volatile (retains data when power is lost).
What does SSD stand for? | Solid State Drive.
What are the advantages of SSDs? | Light, portable, no moving parts, resistant to damage, high data transfer rates.
What are the disadvantages of SSDs? | Higher cost, limited lifespan (voltage required to write increases over time).
What does RAM stand for? | Random Access Memory.
What is RAM used for? | Fast main memory to store data and programs currently being used by the computer.
Is RAM volatile or non-volatile? | Volatile (loses information when power is lost).
What is typical RAM capacity in computers? | 4GB or 8GB.
What does ROM stand for? | Read Only Memory.
Can ROM be modified? | No, it cannot be modified once programmed.
What is ROM used for? | Storing fixed sequences of instructions like the computer's startup (bootstrap) routine.
Is ROM volatile or non-volatile? | Non-volatile (retains data when powered off).
What is virtual storage? | Storing information remotely (e.g., cloud storage) so it can be accessed by any computer with internet access.
Give 2 examples of virtual storage services. | Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive.
How does virtual storage work technically? | Data is stored on multiple hard drives or SSDs formatted to act as a single piece of storage.
What are the advantages of virtual storage? | Scalability, accessibility from anywhere, data protection, cost-effective.
What are the disadvantages of virtual storage? | Dependence on internet connection, security concerns, ongoing costs.
What is the difference between primary and secondary storage? | Primary storage (RAM, ROM) is used by the OS to run the computer; secondary storage stores user data like images and videos.
What factors should you consider when choosing a storage device? | Storage needs, performance needs, portability, and cost.
What type of storage is fastest? | Flash storage (SSDs).
What type of storage has the highest capacity? | Magnetic storage (HDDs).
What type of storage is most portable? | USB flash drives.
What is the typical storage capacity of a CD? | 700MB.
What is the typical storage capacity of a DVD? | 4.7GB to 9GB.
What is the typical storage capacity of a Blu-ray disc? | 25GB to 50GB.
Why is RAM more expensive than secondary storage? | RAM has higher access speeds and is more expensive per gigabyte.
Why is flash memory more expensive than magnetic or optical storage? | Flash technology is faster and more advanced, resulting in higher cost per gigabyte.
What happens to data in RAM when power is lost? | It is lost (RAM is volatile).
What happens to data in ROM when power is lost? | It is retained (ROM is non-volatile).
What is stored in RAM? | Data and programs currently being used, code instructions to execute, files required by running programs.
What is stored in ROM? | BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or firmware used for computer startup.
Can the processor write to ROM? | No, ROM is read-only.
Can the processor write to RAM? | Yes, RAM can be read from and written to.
What does BIOS stand for? | Basic Input/Output System.
Why are SSDs replacing HDDs? | Same functionality but improved performance, no moving parts, faster, more durable.
What is the main disadvantage of magnetic tape? | Bulky and was superseded by more modern technology.
What factors affect input device selection for a user? | User needs, user skills, environment, and cost.
What factors affect output device selection for a user? | User needs, user skills, environment, and cost.
Why might a graphic designer need a graphics tablet? | To draw or sketch directly onto a computer for design work.
Why might an office need wired mice instead of wireless? | To prevent theft in public computer labs.
What is the purpose of a barcode reader? | To read information from printed labels and cards in supermarkets and access control systems.
What is the purpose of a magnetic stripe reader? | To read data from magnetic stripes on cards like credit and debit cards.
What is a webcam used for? | Taking photos and recording videos.
What is a projector used for? | Projecting video content from a computer onto a screen.
