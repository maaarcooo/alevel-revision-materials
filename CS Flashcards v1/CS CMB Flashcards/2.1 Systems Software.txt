What is an operating system? | A collection of programs that provide an interface between the user and computer, managing memory, resources, and low-level tasks.
What are the main functions of an operating system? | Memory management, resource management (scheduling), file management, I/O management (device drivers), interrupt management, utility software, security, and user interface.
What is paging? | Splitting memory into equal-sized sections (pages) that can be swapped between main memory and hard disk as needed.
What is segmentation? | Splitting memory into logical-sized divisions (segments) of varying sizes that represent the structure and logical flow of a program.
What is virtual memory? | Using a section of the hard drive to act as RAM when main memory is insufficient, allowing programs not currently in use to be temporarily stored.
What is disk thrashing? | When pages are swapped too frequently between hard disk and main memory, causing the computer to freeze as more time is spent transferring than running programs.
What is an interrupt? | A signal generated by software or hardware to indicate to the processor that a process needs attention.
What is an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)? | A special function that handles a particular interrupt type when the processor responds to an interrupt signal.
Where are interrupts stored? | In a priority queue in a special register called an interrupt register, ordered by their priority.
What happens when the processor checks for interrupts? | At the end of each Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle, the processor checks the interrupt register for any interrupts of higher priority than the current process.
What are the steps in the ISR process? | 1) Current register contents saved to stack 2) ISR loaded into RAM 3) Flag set 4) ISR executed 5) Flag reset 6) Registers restored 7) FDE cycle resumes.
What is pre-emptive scheduling? | Jobs are actively made to start and stop by the operating system (e.g., Round Robin, Shortest Remaining Time).
What is non-pre-emptive scheduling? | Once a job starts, it runs until completion without interruption (e.g., First Come First Served, Shortest Job First).
How does Round Robin scheduling work? | Each job is given an equal time slice (quantum) to execute. If not completed, it moves to the back of the queue.
What is First Come First Served (FCFS) scheduling? | Jobs are processed in chronological order by which they entered the queue, without considering priority.
What is Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduling? | Uses multiple queues ordered by different priorities. Shorter and more critical tasks are processed first, with jobs trickling down to lower priority queues if they exceed the time quantum.
What is Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling? | Jobs are ordered by burst time from shortest to longest, with shorter jobs at the front of the queue.
What is Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) scheduling? | A pre-emptive version of SJF where processes with the shortest remaining time have higher priority.
What is processor starvation? | When a process does not receive enough processor time to execute and complete.
What is a distributed operating system? | An OS run across multiple devices, allowing the load to be spread across multiple processors when a task is run.
What is an embedded operating system? | An OS built to perform a small range of specific tasks for a specific device, with limited functionality but low power consumption.
What is a multi-tasking operating system? | An OS that enables users to carry out tasks seemingly simultaneously by using time slicing to switch quickly between programs.
What is a multi-user operating system? | An OS where multiple users use one computer (typically a supercomputer), requiring a scheduling algorithm to share processor time fairly.
What is a real-time operating system? | An OS designed to perform a task within a guaranteed time frame, used in time-critical systems like nuclear power stations or self-driving cars.
What is BIOS? | Basic Input Output System - the first program that runs when a computer starts, performing POST and loading the operating system.
What is POST? | Power-On Self-Test - diagnostic testing that ensures all hardware components are correctly connected and functional.
What is the bootstrap/bootloader? | The program that loads the operating system from the hard disk into main memory after POST completes.
What is a device driver? | A computer program that allows the operating system to interact with hardware devices.
Why are device drivers specific? | They are specific to both the computer's architecture (device type) and the operating system installed on the device.
What is a virtual machine (VM)? | A software implementation of a computer system that provides an environment with a translator for intermediate code to run.
What is intermediate code? | Code halfway between machine code and object code that is independent of processor architecture, allowing it to be used across different machines and operating systems.
What are the benefits of virtual machines? | Protection from malware, running incompatible software, testing on different operating systems, and saving time/money by not purchasing multiple devices.
What is a drawback of virtual machines? | Running intermediate code in a VM is considerably slower compared to running low-level code on the device it was designed for.
What is internal fragmentation? | Wasted space within a page when data doesn't fill the entire page, which cannot be used by other data.
What is external fragmentation? | Physical gaps in memory that reduce the maximum size of new segments that can be allocated as segments fill up memory.
What are the three types of interrupts? | Hardware interrupts (from external devices), software interrupts (from OS or software), and trap interrupts (intentionally triggered by programs).
What is interrupt nesting? | The ability of the processor to handle interrupts within interrupts, allowing higher-priority interrupts to interrupt lower-priority ones.
What are examples of hardware interrupts? | Keyboard input, mouse movements, disk I/O requests, printer completion signals, power failure signals.
What are examples of software interrupts? | Application requests to open a file, division by zero errors, system calls.
What is the advantage of Round Robin scheduling? | Each job receives a fair share of CPU time, making it predictable and good for time-sharing systems.
What is the disadvantage of Round Robin scheduling? | Longer jobs take much longer to complete due to execution being split into multiple cycles, and it doesn't account for job priority.
What is the advantage of FCFS scheduling? | Simple and straightforward to implement, fair in that processes are served in order of arrival.
What is the disadvantage of FCFS scheduling? | Can lead to poor performance if a long process arrives before shorter ones; high-priority tasks must wait their turn.
What is the advantage of MLFQ scheduling? | Smaller tasks are prioritised, creating an efficient prioritisation system for similar-sized tasks.
What is the disadvantage of MLFQ scheduling? | More complex than other algorithms; setting correct parameters can be difficult.
What is the advantage of SJF scheduling? | Minimises waiting time and is efficient for short processes.
What is the disadvantage of SJF scheduling? | Requires knowing burst time in advance; long processes can starve if short processes keep arriving.
What is the advantage of SRT scheduling? | Ideal for jobs with shorter burst times; can be aligned with CPU for best performance using time quantum.
What is the disadvantage of SRT scheduling? | Requires knowing burst time in advance; high context switching overhead; long jobs can starve.
What happens when virtual memory fills up? | Disk thrashing occurs, causing the computer to freeze as pages are swapped too frequently.
How does paging help memory management? | It allows programs to be broken into equal-sized chunks that can be efficiently swapped between memory and storage as needed.
How does segmentation help memory management? | It allocates memory based on logical program structure, making it space-efficient by only allocating needed space.
How does virtual memory help memory management? | It creates an illusion of larger memory, enabling more programs to run simultaneously through paging to hard disk.
What is a time quantum/time slice? | A fixed amount of processor time allocated to each process in pre-emptive scheduling algorithms like Round Robin.
What role does the interrupt register play? | It stores interrupts in order of priority as a priority queue for the processor to check.
What is a flag in interrupt handling? | A signal set when an ISR begins execution and reset when it completes, indicating the ISR is running.
Why are interrupts stored in priority order? | To ensure more urgent/important processes are serviced before less critical ones.
What is the difference between distributed and embedded OS? | Distributed runs across multiple devices to spread load; embedded runs on a single device for specific limited tasks.
Why do real-time OS guarantee response times? | To ensure safety-critical tasks in systems like nuclear power stations or self-driving cars respond within required timeframes.
What happens if BIOS is corrupted? | The computer cannot perform POST or load the bootstrap program, preventing the operating system from starting.
Why are device drivers necessary? | To translate communication between the operating system and hardware devices with different architectures.
How do VMs provide cross-platform compatibility? | By allowing software designed for one OS (e.g., MacOS) to run on a different OS (e.g., Windows) through virtualisation.
How do VMs help with software testing? | They provide isolated, safe environments for testing across multiple OS versions without affecting the host system.
What is a hypervisor? | Software that manages multiple virtual machines running on a single physical machine.
Why might VMs be slower than physical machines? | Because they share system resources with the host OS and require additional processing layers.
What is the purpose of utility software? | To help with system maintenance and security through tools like disk defragmentation, backup, and file encryption.
What does file encryption utility do? | Encodes file contents into non-readable format for secure transfer over networks.
What does disk defragmentation utility do? | Reorganises files on the hard disk so they can be found and accessed faster.
What does disk cleanup utility do? | Scans the hard disk for duplicate and corrupt files and deletes them to free up space.

What is the purpose of file management in an OS? | To handle the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data files through a GUI showing the file system.
What is resource management in an OS? | Managing the computer's resources (CPU, memory, disk drives, printers) by allocating them to specific tasks and ensuring efficient use.
What is interrupt management in an OS? | Handling interrupt events that require immediate CPU attention to maintain smooth system operation.
What security features do operating systems provide? | Password-protected accounts, firewalls, virus scanning, file encryption, and user permission restrictions.
