What is applications software? | Software designed to be used by the end-user to perform one specific task (e.g. word processing, web browsers, spreadsheets).
What is systems software? | Low-level software responsible for running the computer system smoothly, interacting with hardware and providing a platform for applications software to run.
Give three examples of utility software. | Compression, disk defragmentation, antivirus, automatic updating, backup.
What does disk defragmentation do? | Rearranges contents of the hard drive so files can be accessed faster, improving performance.
What is open source software? | Software where the source code is freely available and can be redistributed and modified by anyone.
What is closed source software? | Software where the source code is hidden and proprietary. Users need a license and cannot access or modify the source code.
Give one advantage of open source software. | Can be modified and improved by anyone, often free to use, customisable.
Give one disadvantage of open source software. | Support available online may be insufficient or incorrect. Lower security as may not be developed in a controlled environment.
Give one advantage of closed source software. | Thorough, regular and well-tested updates. Professional support and high levels of security.
Give one disadvantage of closed source software. | License restricts usage, users cannot modify the software themselves, can be costly.
What is a translator? | A program that converts high-level source code into low-level object code.
Name the three types of translator. | Compiler, interpreter, assembler.
How does a compiler work? | Translates entire source code into machine code all at once, then executes it.
How does an interpreter work? | Translates and executes code line-by-line, stopping at errors.
What does an assembler do? | Translates assembly language into machine code on almost a one-to-one basis.
Give one advantage of a compiler. | Faster execution time once compiled. Code can run without the translator present.
Give one disadvantage of a compiler. | Longer initial compilation time. Entire program must be recompiled if changes are made.
Give one advantage of an interpreter. | Easier to debug and allows incremental testing. Faster to start execution.
Give one disadvantage of an interpreter. | Slower execution time overall. Interpreter must be present during execution.
What are the four stages of compilation? | Lexical analysis, syntax analysis, code generation, optimisation.
What happens during lexical analysis? | Whitespace and comments are removed. Code is analysed for keywords and identifiers which are replaced with tokens. Information is stored in a symbol table.
What is a token? | A small meaningful unit in programming language (e.g. keywords, identifiers, operators, separators).
What happens during syntax analysis? | Tokens are analysed against the grammar and rules of the programming language. Syntax errors are flagged.
What is produced after syntax analysis? | An abstract syntax tree (AST) - a graph-based representation of the code.
What happens during code generation? | The abstract syntax tree is used to produce machine code that can be executed.
What happens during optimisation? | Code is modified to make it more efficient without changing functionality. Redundant code is removed and repeated sections may be grouped.
What is a library? | A collection of pre-compiled programs/functions that can be incorporated into other programs using static or dynamic linking.
Give one advantage of using libraries. | Ready-to-use and error-free. Save time developing and testing. Can be reused in multiple programs.
What does a linker do? | Links external modules and libraries included within the code. Combines different code files into a single executable.
What is static linking? | Modules and libraries are added directly into the main file. Increases file size but external updates don't affect the program.
What is dynamic linking? | Addresses of modules and libraries are included in the file. The loader retrieves programs at runtime. Files remain small and external updates feed through.
What does a loader do? | Retrieves libraries or subroutines from memory locations when a file is executed.
What is assembly code? | A low-level language that is the 'next level up' from machine code. Platform specific and dependent on the processor's instruction set.
Give two examples of syntax errors. | Undeclared variable type, incomplete set of brackets, missing semicolons.
Give two examples of semantic errors. | Multiple declaration, undeclared identifiers.
What is source code? | Code written by a programmer before it has been compiled (object code).
What is machine code? | The same as object code - binary code that can be executed by a computer.
Why use optimisation during compilation? | To make code faster to execute and reduce memory required, though it can add to overall compilation time.
