2.3 Software Development - Flashcards

What is a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)? | An approach to developing software with common stages including analysis, design, development, testing, implementation, evaluation, and maintenance.
What happens during the Analysis stage? | Stakeholders state requirements, the problem is clearly defined, and system requirements are established by analysing current solutions and considering data types.
What is designed during the Design stage? | Inputs (volume, methods, frequency), outputs, security features, hardware setup, user interface, and a test plan.
What happens during the Development stage? | The project is split into individual, self-contained modules which are allocated to teams for programming.
What is Alpha testing? | Testing carried out in-house by software development teams to pinpoint and fix bugs.
What is Beta testing? | Testing carried out by end-users after alpha testing, with user feedback informing the next development stage.
What is White box testing? | Testing based on the internal structure of the program where all possible routes through the program are tested.
What is Black box testing? | Testing where software is tested without testers knowing the internal structure, tracing inputs and outputs.
What happens during the Implementation stage? | The software is installed onto users' systems after appropriate changes from testing.
What happens during the Evaluation stage? | Software effectiveness is evaluated against system requirements considering robustness, reliability, portability, and maintainability.
What happens during the Maintenance stage? | End-users flag errors or improvements, and programmers send regular updates to fix bugs, security issues, or make improvements.
What is the Waterfall model? | A sequential software development process where stages are completed in order from start to finish.
What does TELOS stand for in feasibility studies? | Technical, Economic, Legal, Operational, Scheduling.
What does the T in TELOS assess? | Technical - is the project possible considering available technology?
What does the E in TELOS assess? | Economic - can the project be financed short-term and long-term?
What does the L in TELOS assess? | Legal - can the project be solved within the law?
What does the O in TELOS assess? | Operational - can the project be successfully implemented and maintained?
What does the S in TELOS assess? | Scheduling - can the project be completed given the time available?
What is a key drawback of the Waterfall model regarding changes? | It is inflexible - programmers must revisit all levels between the current stage and where a change needs to be made.
What are three benefits of the Waterfall model? | Simple and linear, clear stages and milestones, suitable for well-defined projects.
What are three drawbacks of the Waterfall model? | Inflexible, expensive to fix late problems, long development cycle.
When is the Waterfall model most suitable? | For projects where requirements are well understood, unlikely to change, and high quality/compliance are essential.
What are Agile methodologies? | A collection of methodologies that improve flexibility of software development and adapt to changes in user requirements faster.
How does Agile handle different sections of software? | The problem is broken down into sections developed in parallel, with different sections at different stages.
What is prioritised more in Agile development? | User satisfaction over documentation.
What is delivered early in Agile development? | A working prototype, which is improved iteratively with new prototypes delivered regularly.
What is Extreme Programming (XP)? | An agile model where development teams consist of paired programmers alongside a representative end-user.
What are "user stories" in XP? | System requirements specified by the end-user and used when designing the program.
What is the aim of paired programming in XP? | To produce high-quality code - one person writes while the other critiques, improving it as it's written.
What is a "working version" in XP? | Each iteration generates a version of the program that could function as the final product.
What are three benefits of Extreme Programming? | Highly adaptable, frequent communication, quality focus with continuous testing.
What are three drawbacks of Extreme Programming? | Requires experienced team members, intensive collaboration can lead to burnout, may lack documentation.
When is Extreme Programming most suitable? | For small to medium-sized projects where requirements can change and customer involvement is high.
What are the four key stages of the Spiral model? | Analysing system requirements, pinpointing and mitigating risks, development/testing/implementation, and evaluating to inform next iteration.
What happens if a project is too risky in the Spiral model? | The project is terminated.
Why is the Spiral model expensive? | Hiring risk assessors to analyse risks can be costly.
What are three benefits of the Spiral model? | Thorough risk analysis and mitigation, caters to changing user needs, produces prototypes throughout.
What are three drawbacks of the Spiral model? | Expensive to hire risk assessors, lack of focus on code efficiency, high costs due to constant prototyping.
When is the Spiral model most suitable? | For large, risk-intensive projects with a high budget.
What is Rapid Application Development (RAD)? | An iterative methodology using partially functioning prototypes that are continually built upon.
How are user requirements initially gathered in RAD? | Using focus groups to develop an incomplete version of the solution for users to trial.
How does RAD handle user feedback? | User feedback generates the next improved prototype until it matches end-user requirements.
When is RAD commonly used? | Where user requirements are incomplete or unclear at the start.
What is a potential drawback of RAD regarding code quality? | As requirements change, additions and changes to code may be inefficient.
What are three benefits of RAD? | Caters to changing user requirements, highly usable finished product, focus on core features reduces development time.
What are three drawbacks of RAD? | Poorer quality documentation, fast pace may reduce code quality, requires strong team collaboration.
When is RAD most suitable? | For small to medium, low-budget projects with short timeframes.
What is an algorithm? | A set of instructions used to solve a problem.
What are six qualities of good algorithms? | Clearly defined inputs, always produces valid output, handles invalid inputs, reaches stopping condition, well-documented, well-commented.
What is the main benefit of Waterfall regarding management? | It is straightforward to manage with clear documentation.
What is the main benefit of Agile regarding code? | It produces high quality code with regular user input.
What is the main benefit of the Spiral model regarding risk? | Thorough risk-analysis and mitigation.
What is the main benefit of RAD regarding speed? | Faster development with focus on core features, reducing development time.
What is the main drawback of Waterfall regarding flexibility? | Lack of flexibility with no risk analysis and limited user involvement.
What is the main drawback of Agile regarding documentation? | Poor documentation that requires consistent interaction between user and programmer.
What is the main drawback of Spiral regarding cost? | Expensive to hire risk assessors with high costs due to constant prototyping.
What is the main drawback of RAD regarding collaboration? | Collaboration dependence, less scalable, and potential quality issues.
