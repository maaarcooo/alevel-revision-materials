What is a class in OOP? | A blueprint or template used to create objects with specific attributes and methods.
What is an object in OOP? | A specific instance of a class with its own state and behaviours.
What is instantiation? | The term used for creating an object from a class.
What are attributes also known as? | Class variables (in a class) or instance variables (in an object).
What is the identifier? | The name used to refer to an object.
What is a method? | A function or procedure that belongs to a class and defines actions/behaviours objects can perform.
What is the difference between a function and a procedure? | A function must return a value; a procedure does not need to return a value.
What does public access mean for methods? | The method can be accessed by any code within the same class or from external classes.
What does private access mean for methods? | The method can only be accessed within the same class, not by external code.
What is the default access level if public or private is not specified? | Public.
What is a constructor? | A special method automatically called when an object is created (instantiated).
What do constructors typically do? | Define initial values of instance variables and perform setup to prepare the object for use.
How do objects use methods from their class? | Using dot notation: objectName.methodName()
What are instance methods? | Methods associated with individual instances (objects) of a class that operate on specific data.
What are static methods? | Methods associated with the class itself that can be called without creating an instance.
What data types can attributes be? | Integers, strings, Booleans, or even other objects.
Can local variables within methods have access modifiers? | No, they are local to the method and have limited scope.
What is inheritance in OOP? | When a class inherits properties and behaviours (methods and attributes) from another class.
What is the base class? | The parent class or superclass that other classes inherit from.
What is the derived class? | The child class or subclass that inherits from the base class.
What relationship does inheritance establish? | An "IS-A" relationship (e.g., a Car IS-A Vehicle).
What is the main benefit of inheritance? | Code reuse - derived classes can use existing code from the base class without duplication.
What is the super keyword used for? | To refer to the superclass and access its members from within the subclass.
What is encapsulation? | The practice of grouping data (attributes) and methods within a class to keep data secure.
How does encapsulation control access to data? | Using access modifiers (public, private) to control how data can be accessed.
What is abstraction in OOP? | Hiding implementation details to reduce complexity and make objects easier to understand.
Why are private variables important for encapsulation? | They are only accessible within the class itself, preventing external code from directly accessing them.
How do you modify private attributes from outside a class? | Through public methods that provide controlled access to the private data.
What is polymorphism? | The concept that allows objects to take on different forms or behaviours.
What is method overloading? | When multiple methods have the same name but execute different code.
What is method overriding? | Providing a new implementation for a method already defined in the parent class.
What keyword is used for method overriding? | The override keyword.
How does polymorphism allow treating different objects as a common group? | Objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass.
What is an example of polymorphism with storage? | An array of type Vehicle can store both Car and Motorcycle objects.
What are prebuilt classes? | Classes already included in a programming language that provide common functionality.
Give examples of prebuilt Java classes. | Date, Calendar, String, Random, Scanner.
What are custom classes? | Classes created by the programmer to define new data types.
What happens when a derived class object calls an overridden method? | The method from the derived class executes, not the base class version.
Why is polymorphism useful for code maintenance? | It provides flexibility and makes code more maintainable and modular.
What does code reusability mean? | The same object or class can be used in different parts of a program without rewriting code.
How does encapsulation promote code organization? | By keeping related data and methods together within an object.
What is the benefit of using public methods to access private data? | It provides controlled, safe access to data while maintaining encapsulation.
