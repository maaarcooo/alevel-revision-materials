What is compression? | The process used to reduce the storage space required by a file, allowing more files to be stored and faster transfer over networks.
What are the two main categories of compression? | Lossy and lossless compression.
What is lossy compression? | Compression that reduces file size by removing some data permanently. The original file cannot be fully recovered.
What is lossless compression? | Compression that reduces file size without losing any information. The original file can be fully recovered.
When should lossy compression be used? | For media streaming where some quality loss is acceptable and small file sizes are needed, such as social media images or audio.
When should lossless compression be used? | When data integrity is essential, such as for text files, professional logos, or archival storage.
What is Run Length Encoding (RLE)? | A lossless compression method where repeated values are replaced with one occurrence of the data followed by the number of times it repeats.
Give an example of Run Length Encoding. | The string "AAAAAABBBBBCCC" becomes "A6B5C3".
What is a limitation of Run Length Encoding? | It only works well when there is consecutive repetition. Without repetition, it doesn't reduce file size significantly.
What is dictionary coding? | A lossless compression method where frequently occurring data is replaced with shorter index codes and stored with a dictionary.
Why must dictionary-compressed data be transferred with its dictionary? | Without the dictionary, the data cannot be decompressed or used.
What is encryption? | The process of scrambling data to keep it secure during transmission, making it unreadable without the proper key.
What is symmetric encryption? | Encryption where both sender and receiver share the same private key for both encrypting and decrypting data.
What is the main advantage of symmetric encryption? | It is faster and more efficient for encrypting large amounts of data.
What is the main disadvantage of symmetric encryption? | The challenge of securely sharing the private key between sender and receiver. If intercepted, all communications can be decrypted.
What is asymmetric encryption? | Encryption using two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
How does asymmetric encryption work? | The sender encrypts data with the recipient's public key. Only the recipient's private key can decrypt it.
What is the main advantage of asymmetric encryption? | It solves the key distribution problem since the public key can be shared openly without compromising security.
What is the main disadvantage of asymmetric encryption? | It is slower than symmetric encryption.
When should symmetric encryption be used? | For large files and databases where speed is important and the same person encrypts and decrypts.
When should asymmetric encryption be used? | For confidential communications requiring high security, such as passwords, bank details, or government communications.
What is hashing? | A process that converts any data into a fixed-size string of characters (called a hash or digest).
What is a key property of hash functions? | The same input always produces the same hash, but even a minor change in input produces a completely different hash.
Can a hash be reversed to get the original data? | No, hash functions are one-way and cannot be reversed.
Name three common hashing algorithms. | MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.
Why is hashing useful for storing passwords? | Passwords are stored as hashes rather than plaintext. Even if the database is compromised, the original passwords cannot be retrieved.
How does password verification work with hashing? | The entered password is hashed and compared against the stored hash. If they match, access is granted.
What is a hash collision? | When two different pieces of data produce the same hash value.
What makes a good hash function? | Low chance of collision, quick to calculate, and output smaller than input.
How does hashing improve database lookup efficiency? | Hash digests have fixed length, making it faster to compare than variable-length strings like email addresses.
How can hashing verify data integrity? | If two hashes are identical, the data hasn't been altered during transmission. Same data with the same hash function produces the same digest.
What is the main difference between encryption and hashing? | Encryption is reversible (can be decrypted), while hashing is irreversible (one-way function).
What is a hash table? | A data structure that holds key-value pairs, allowing constant-time data lookup using hash functions.
Where are hash tables commonly used? | In caches, databases, and situations requiring fast data retrieval with constant access times.
What are digital signatures based on? | Asymmetric encryption where a message encrypted with a private key proves the sender's identity, as only they have that private key.
