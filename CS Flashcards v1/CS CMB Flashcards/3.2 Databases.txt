What is an entity in a database? | An item of interest about which information is stored.
What is a relational database? | A database that recognises differences between entities by creating different tables for each entity.
What is a flat file database? | A database consisting of a single file, typically based around a single entity and its attributes.
What is a primary key? | A unique identifier for each record in a table.
What is a foreign key? | An attribute that links two tables together. It exists in one table as the primary key and acts as the foreign key in another.
What is a secondary key? | An attribute that allows a database to be searched quickly. It is indexed to make searching easier.
What are attributes? | Characteristics of an entity - categories about which data is collected.
What is a one-to-one relationship? | Each entity can only be linked to one other entity (e.g. husband and wife).
What is a one-to-many relationship? | One entity can be associated with many other entities (e.g. mother and children).
What is a many-to-many relationship? | One entity can be associated with many other entities and vice versa (e.g. students and courses).
What is normalisation? | The process of coming up with the best possible layout for a relational database.
What are the goals of normalisation? | No redundancy, consistent data throughout linked tables, records can be added/removed without issues, complex queries can be carried out.
What is First Normal Form (1NF)? | No attribute contains more than a single value.
What is Second Normal Form (2NF)? | A database in 1NF with no partial dependencies - no attributes depend on only part of a composite key.
What is Third Normal Form (3NF)? | A database in 2NF with no non-key dependencies - attributes only depend on the primary key.
What is indexing? | A method to store the position of each record ordered by a certain attribute to access data quickly.
What is automatically indexed in a database? | The primary key.
What is OMR? | Optical Mark Recognition - detects marked areas on paper using a special machine.
What is OCR? | Optical Character Recognition - converts printed or handwritten text into digital format.
What is a barcode? | A machine-readable representation of data using parallel lines of varying widths and spacings.

What does SQL stand for? | Structured Query Language.
What does the SELECT statement do? | Collects fields from a given table.
What does the FROM statement do? | Specifies which table(s) information will come from.
What does the WHERE statement do? | Specifies search criteria to filter data.
What does the LIKE operator do? | Filters data based on a specific pattern.

What does the wildcard * do in SQL? | Selects all columns in a table.
What does the wildcard % do in SQL? | Used as a wildcard character in the LIKE operator to match patterns.
What does JOIN do in SQL? | Combines rows from multiple tables based on a common field between them.
What does INSERT INTO do? | Adds new data to a database table.
What does DELETE do in SQL? | Removes data from a database table.
What does DROP TABLE do? | Deletes a table in a database.
What is referential integrity? | Ensures consistency between related tables - maintains valid relationships between primary and foreign keys.
What is CASCADE in referential integrity? | Automatically makes changes to related records when a primary key is updated or deleted.
What is a transaction? | A sequence of database operations treated as a single unit of work.
What does ACID stand for? | Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
What is Atomicity in ACID? | A transaction must be processed in its entirety or not at all.
What is Consistency in ACID? | A transaction must maintain referential integrity rules between linked tables.
What is Isolation in ACID? | Simultaneous executions of transactions should lead to the same result as if executed one after another.
What is Durability in ACID? | Once a transaction has been executed it will remain so regardless of circumstances (e.g. power cut).
What is record locking? | Preventing simultaneous access to records in a database to prevent inconsistencies or loss of updates.
What is a deadlock? | When two or more users are waiting for each other to release locked records, causing no progress.
What is redundancy in databases? | Having one or more copies of data in physically different locations.
What is Query By Example (QBE)? | A user-friendly method for constructing database queries using a visual interface.
What is an entity relationship diagram (ERD)? | A diagram that represents entities (tables) and relationships between them in a database.
How is a one-to-one relationship shown in an ERD? | A single line connecting two entities.
How is a one-to-many relationship shown in an ERD? | A single line on one side and a branch (crow's foot) on the other.
How is a many-to-many relationship shown in an ERD? | Branches (crow's feet) on both sides.
How do you resolve a many-to-many relationship? | Create a link table that goes between the entities.
What is a shared lock? | A read lock that allows multiple transactions to read a record simultaneously but prevents modifications.
What is an exclusive lock? | A write lock that allows only one transaction to access and modify a record.
What is a DBMS? | Database Management System - software used to manage databases (e.g. MySQL, Oracle).
What is a field in a database? | A single piece of data in a record.
What is a record in a database? | A group of related fields representing one data entry.
What is a table in a database? | A collection of records with a similar structure.
What is a compound primary key? | A combination of 2 or more fields that is unique for all records.
What are the main data types in SQL? | CHAR(n), VARCHAR(n), BOOLEAN, INTEGER/INT, FLOAT, DATE, TIME, CURRENCY.
What does CHAR(n) mean in SQL? | A string of fixed length n.
What does VARCHAR(n) mean in SQL? | A string of variable length with upper limit n.
What does the ORDER BY clause do? | Specifies whether results should be in ascending or descending order.
How do you order in descending order in SQL? | Add DESC after ORDER BY (e.g. ORDER BY DatePublished DESC).
What does ALTER TABLE do? | Used to add, delete or modify columns in a table.
What does UPDATE do in SQL? | Updates a record in a database table.
What does CREATE TABLE do? | Makes a new database table.
What must be specified when creating a table? | Whether it is the primary key, its data type, whether it must be filled in (NOT NULL).
What is CSV? | Comma Separated Values - a simple data exchange format storing tabular data in plain text.
What is JSON? | JavaScript Object Notation - a lightweight data interchange format using key-value pairs.
What are sensors in data capture? | Devices that detect and respond to changes in environment, converting physical signals into digital data.
What is the benefit of electronic databases over paper-based systems? | Easier to add/delete/modify/update data, data can be backed up easier, multiple users can access simultaneously.
What is the purpose of normalisation? | To reduce data duplication and improve data accuracy and consistency.
Why is a secondary key needed? | Because primary keys are not normally remembered by users, so secondary keys allow searching by more memorable attributes like surname.
What happens if you try to delete a primary key that has foreign keys linked to it? | It should trigger a cascaded delete to maintain referential integrity.
What is a nested SELECT statement? | A SELECT statement within another SELECT statement (a mini select within the main one).
What problem can occur with flat file databases? | Data redundancy, inefficient storage, and difficult to maintain.
Why use a relational database instead of a flat file? | Reduces data redundancy, makes efficient use of storage, and is easier to maintain.
What is concurrency control? | Managing simultaneous access to data in a multi-user environment.
What techniques are used for concurrency control? | Locking (prevents simultaneous access) and timestamping (assigns unique timestamp to each transaction).
