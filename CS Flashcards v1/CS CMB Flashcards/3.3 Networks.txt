What are the four layers of the TCP/IP stack? | Application Layer, Transport Layer, Network Layer, Link Layer.
What does the Application Layer do? | Specifies what protocol needs to be used to relate to the application being sent (e.g., HTTP, POP3, FTP).
What does the Transport Layer do? | Uses TCP to establish end-to-end connection, splits data into packets, labels packets with numbers and port numbers.
What does the Network Layer do? | Adds source and destination IP addresses to packets. Routers operate on this layer to forward packets.
What is a socket address? | The combination of an IP address and a port number.
What does the Link Layer do? | Creates connection between network devices, adds MAC addresses of source and destination computers.
How are packets processed at the receiving computer? | From bottom to top - MAC address removed by Link Layer, IP addresses removed by Network Layer, port number removed and packets reassembled by Transport Layer, data presented by Application Layer.
What is DNS? | Domain Name System - the system used to name and organise internet resources, translating domain names into IP addresses.
What does TLD stand for? | Top Level Domain (e.g., .com, .org, .uk).
What does 2LD stand for? | 2nd Level Domain (e.g., the "google" in google.com).

What does the trailer in a data packet contain? | A checksum or cyclic redundancy check used to detect transmission errors.
What is packet switching? | A method of communication where data is sent in packets across the most efficient route, which can vary for each packet.
What is an advantage of packet switching? | Multiple methods ensure data arrives intact (checksums, cyclic redundancy checks), multiple routes can be used if one breaks.
What is a disadvantage of packet switching? | Time is spent deconstructing and reconstructing packets, must wait for all packets to arrive before data can be received.
What is circuit switching? | A method of communication where a direct link is created between two devices and maintained for the entire conversation.
What is an advantage of circuit switching? | Data arrives in logical order for quicker reconstruction, enables calls without delay in speech.
What is a disadvantage of circuit switching? | Bandwidth is wasted during periods with no data, devices must transfer and receive at same rate, ties up network sections.
What is a firewall? | A device designed to prevent unauthorised access to a network by comparing packets against preconfigured rules.
What is packet filtering? | Limiting network access according to administrator rules by examining source IP, destination IP, protocols, and ports.
What happens when a firewall denies access? | The packet is either dropped (no alert) or rejected (alert sent to sender).
What is a proxy server? | An intermediary that collects and sends data on behalf of the user.
What are benefits of using proxy servers? | User privacy and anonymity, caching frequently used data for faster loading, reducing web traffic, blocking access to sensitive information.
What is encryption? | A way of keeping data secure when transmitting over the Internet by making it unreadable if intercepted.
What is a NIC? | Network Interface Card - hardware required to connect a device to a network, assigns a unique MAC address.
What is a MAC address? | Media Access Control address - a 48-bit value coded into the device, usually written as a twelve-digit hexadecimal number.
What is a switch? | A device used to direct the flow of data across a network, commonly used in star topology networks.
What is a WAP? | Wireless Access Point - a device that allows devices to connect to a network wirelessly.
What is a router? | A device used to connect two or more networks together, allowing private networks to connect to the Internet.
What is a gateway? | A device used when protocols are not the same between networks, translating protocols by removing headers and adding data to packets with new protocol.
What is a client-server network? | A network where powerful server computers control the network and serve clients with services like files, email, and web access.
What are advantages of client-server networks? | More secure with centralised data storage, central backups, data and resources can be shared between clients.
What are disadvantages of client-server networks? | Relatively expensive to set up, functionality depends on server, trained staff required to maintain server.
What is a peer-to-peer network? | A network where computers are connected to each other so they can share files, with each device acting as both server and client.
What are advantages of peer-to-peer networks? | Cheaper to set up, allows resource sharing, easy to maintain, not dependent on central server, no specialist staff required.
What are disadvantages of peer-to-peer networks? | Impossible to trace origin of files, backups must be performed separately, poorer security, may be difficult to locate resources.
Why is WAN infrastructure typically owned by third parties? | WANs usually require extra telecommunication hardware that is too expensive for single organisations to own.
What is the largest WAN? | The Internet, made up of a series of smaller networks.
What is protocol layering? | The way network protocols are divided into layers, each performing specific functions.
Why use protocol layering? | Modularity (easier design and troubleshooting), interoperability (different technologies work together), ease of updates, specialisation.
What is packetising? | The process where a large message is divided into smaller, manageable units called packets.
What information is in a packet header? | Source IP address, destination IP address, sequence number, protocol, packet length, checksum.
What is Time To Live (TTL)? | Information in packet header that tells the packet when to expire so it doesn't travel forever.
What is a hub? | A networking device that connects multiple devices but broadcasts all data to every connected device.
Why are switches preferred over hubs? | Switches only send data to the intended device using a lookup table with MAC addresses, improving security and reducing unnecessary traffic.
What is a modem? | A device that modulates analogue carrier signals to encode digital information and demodulates signals to decode transmitted information.
What does a router do with incoming packets? | Analyses packet headers to determine destination IP address, looks up address in routing table, forwards packet to appropriate network.
What is a hop? | Each pass from router to router as a packet travels to its destination.
What are common types of network cables? | Ethernet cables (Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6) for wired networks, fibre-optic cables for higher speed and larger data capacity.
What is hacking? | Gaining unauthorised access to a system or network to steal/manipulate data, disrupt services, or cause damage.
What is a virus? | Malicious software that attaches to legitimate programs and replicates to spread, causing damage like deleting data.

What is a Trojan horse? | A program that disguises itself as legitimate but can delete data or damage hardware when installed.
What is spyware? | Software that records all key presses and transmits them to a third party.
What is ransomware? | Malware that encrypts user files and demands ransom payment to decrypt them.
What is a DoS attack? | Denial of Service - flooding a server with requests it can't respond to, causing it to crash or become unavailable.
What is a DDoS attack? | Distributed Denial of Service - similar to DoS but using multiple computers as bots to send requests.
