What is the PageRank algorithm formula? | PageRank(x) = (1-d) + d[(PageRank(T1)÷Count(T1)) + ... + (PageRank(Tn)÷Count(Tn))]
What is the damping factor (d) in PageRank typically set to? | 0.85
What is Count(Tn) in the PageRank formula? | The total count of outbound links from a webpage n.
What other factors do modern search engines consider besides PageRank? | The age of a web page and how quickly content on the web page loads.
What is server side processing? | When a client sends data to a server for it to be processed, meaning no information is processed on the client computer.
Name two common server side scripting languages. | SQL and PHP.
Give four advantages of server side processing. | 1) Does not require plugins, 2) Can perform large calculations faster than clients, 3) Not browser dependent, 4) More secure.
What is client side processing? | When a client processes data on a local device, meaning all information is processed on the client computer.
What is another name for client side processing? | Client side scripting.
Name a common client side scripting language. | JavaScript.
Give three advantages of client side processing. | 1) Webpage can immediately respond to user actions, 2) Executes quickly, 3) Gives developers more control over the behaviour and look of the website.
What does an index of web pages contain? | Keywords, phrases, and metadata collected by web crawlers from websites across the Internet.
Why is the order of web resources in search results important? | It determines which websites users choose to visit and use, so high-quality websites with relevant content should appear first.
In the PageRank algorithm, what initial value is assumed for unknown page ranks in the first iteration? | 1
What does CSS stand for? | Cascading Style Sheets.
Can CSS be applied to HTML tags like <h1>, <p>, and <div>? | Yes, CSS can be used to specify the way these HTML elements look.
