What does RISC stand for? | Reduced Instruction Set Computer
What is the key characteristic of RISC processors? | Small instruction set where each instruction is approximately one line of machine code and takes one clock cycle
What does CISC stand for? | Complex Instruction Set Computer
What is the key characteristic of CISC processors? | Large instruction set designed to accomplish tasks in as few lines of assembly code as possible, with instructions built into hardware
How many lines of code does it take to multiply two numbers in RISC? | 4 lines (LDA R1, X; LDA R2, Y; MULT R1, R2; STO R1, X)
How many lines of code does it take to multiply two numbers in CISC? | 1 line (MULT A, B)
Which processor type requires the compiler to do more work? | RISC - the compiler must translate high-level code into more lines of machine code
Which processor type requires more RAM? | RISC - because the code is longer and requires more storage
Which processor type allows pipelining? | RISC - because each instruction takes one clock cycle
What is a disadvantage of CISC processors? | Many specialised instructions are created, but only a few are actually used
Where are CISC processors commonly used today? | In microcontrollers and embedded systems
What is a multi-core CPU? | A CPU with multiple independent cores that can complete instructions separately, resulting in higher performance
How do parallel systems differ from multi-core systems? | Parallel systems complete tasks with a single core using threading, while multi-core systems use multiple physical cores
Which performs better for larger projects: multi-core or parallel systems? | Multi-core systems
What is a GPU? | Graphics Processing Unit - a device with many independent processors that work in parallel
What type of processor is a GPU classified as? | A co-processor (secondary processor that supplements the primary processor)
What tasks are GPUs particularly efficient at? | Repetitive tasks such as image processing and machine learning
Why are GPUs efficient at repetitive tasks? | They have many independent processors working in parallel
