What is an operating system? | A collection of programs that provide an interface between the user and computer, managing memory, resources, and low-level tasks.
Name four key functions of an operating system. | Memory management, resource management (scheduling), file management, input/output management, interrupt management, utility software, security, and user interface.
What is paging? | Memory management technique that splits memory into equal-sized sections called pages, which can be swapped between main memory and hard disk as needed.
What is segmentation? | Memory management technique that splits memory into logical sized divisions (segments) of varying sizes, representing program structure like conditional statements or loops.
What is virtual memory? | A section of the hard drive used to act as RAM when main memory is insufficient, storing unused program sections temporarily.
What is disk thrashing? | When the computer freezes because pages are swapped too frequently between hard disk and main memory, spending more time transferring than executing programs.
What are interrupts? | Signals generated by software or hardware to indicate to the processor that a process needs attention.
Where are interrupts stored? | In a priority queue in a special register called an interrupt register, ordered by priority.
What does ISR stand for? | Interrupt Service Routine.
When does the processor check for interrupts? | At the end of each Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle.
What happens to register contents when an interrupt is serviced? | Current contents of special purpose registers are temporarily transferred into a stack, then restored after the ISR completes.
What is a flag in interrupt handling? | A signal set to indicate that an ISR has begun, then reset when the interrupt is serviced.
What is the difference between pre-emptive and non-pre-emptive scheduling? | Pre-emptive: jobs are actively started and stopped by the OS. Non-pre-emptive: once started, jobs run until completion.
Describe Round Robin scheduling. | Each job receives an equal time slice of processor time. Jobs cycle through until completion. Does not account for priority.
What is a disadvantage of Round Robin scheduling? | Longer jobs take much longer to complete due to execution being split into multiple cycles, and it doesn't consider job priority.
Describe First Come First Served (FCFS) scheduling. | Jobs are processed in chronological order of arrival. Simple to implement but doesn't allocate time based on priority.
What are Multilevel Feedback Queues? | Multiple queues each ordered by different priorities. Difficult to implement due to deciding which priority to favour.
Describe Shortest Job First scheduling. | Queue ordered by completion time, with longest jobs at the end. Suited to batch systems but requires knowing job duration and risks processor starvation.
What is processor starvation? | When a particular process does not receive enough processor time to execute and be completed.
Describe Shortest Remaining Time scheduling. | Queue ordered by time left for completion, with shortest remaining jobs serviced first. Risk of starvation for longer jobs.
What is a distributed operating system? | An OS run across multiple devices, allowing load to be spread across multiple processors.
What is an embedded operating system? | OS built to perform a small range of specific tasks for a specific device. Limited functionality, hard to update, but consumes less power.
What is a multi-tasking operating system? | Enables users to carry out tasks seemingly simultaneously by using time slicing to switch quickly between programs.
What is a multi-user operating system? | Multiple users share one computer (typically a supercomputer). Requires scheduling algorithm to share processor time fairly and avoid starvation.
What is a real-time operating system? | Designed to perform tasks within a guaranteed time frame. Used in time-critical systems like nuclear power stations or self-driving cars.
What does BIOS stand for? | Basic Input Output System.
What is the role of BIOS? | First program that runs at start-up, running tests (POST, checking CPU/memory, testing external devices) before loading the OS into RAM.
What does POST stand for? | Power-On Self Test.
What does POST check? | Ensures all hardware (keyboards, disk drives) are correctly connected and functional.
What is another name for BIOS? | Bootstrap or bootloader.
What are device drivers? | Computer programs provided by the OS that allow it to interact with hardware.
Why are device drivers specific? | They are specific to both the computer's architecture and the operating system installed on the device.
What is a virtual machine? | A software implementation of a computer system that provides an environment with a translator for intermediate code to run.
What is intermediate code? | Code halfway between machine code and object code, independent of processor architecture, usable across different machines and OS.
Give three uses of virtual machines. | Testing programs on different OS, protection from malware (affects VM not device), running incompatible software.
What is an advantage of using virtual machines for testing? | Saves time and money compared to purchasing multiple physical devices.
What is a disadvantage of virtual machines? | Running intermediate code in a VM is considerably slower than running low-level code on native hardware.
Name three examples of interrupts. | Printer completing a print job, peripheral signalling power failure, hardware or software signals needing processor attention.
Which scheduling algorithms are pre-emptive? | Multilevel Feedback Queues, Shortest Remaining Time, Round Robin.
Which scheduling algorithms are non-pre-emptive? | First Come First Served, Shortest Job First.
What scheduling algorithm does Windows typically use? | Multilevel feedback queues.
What are the three main memory management techniques? | Paging, segmentation, and virtual memory.
What data structure is used to store interrupts? | A priority queue (FIFO - First In First Out).
What data structure stores register contents during interrupt handling? | A stack (LIFO - Last In First Out).
Give an example of where embedded OS are used. | Consumer appliances like coffee machines and washing machines, as well as in-car systems.
What registers are mentioned in connection with the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle? | PC (Program Counter), MAR (Memory Address Register), MDR (Memory Data Register), CIR (Current Instruction Register), and ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit).
