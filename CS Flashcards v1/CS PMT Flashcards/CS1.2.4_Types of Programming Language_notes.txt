What are programming paradigms? | Different approaches to using a programming language to solve a problem.
What are the two broad categories of programming paradigms? | Imperative and declarative.
What paradigms fall under imperative programming? | Procedural and object-oriented.
What paradigms fall under declarative programming? | Logic and functional.
What is imperative programming? | Code that clearly specifies the actions to be performed.
What is procedural programming? | A type of imperative programming using a sequence of instructions carried out step-by-step, which may be contained within procedures.
Give three examples of procedural languages. | Pascal, Python, Logo.
What is object-oriented programming (OOP)? | Programming built on objects formed from classes which have attributes and methods, focusing on reusable and maintainable programs.
Give three examples of object-oriented languages. | Python, Delphi, Java.
What is declarative programming? | Programming that focuses on stating the desired result rather than the exact instructions needed, with the language determining how to obtain the result.
What is functional programming? | Programming that uses reusable functions as the core, with programs made of function calls often combined within each other.
Give three examples of functional languages. | Haskell, C#, Java.
What is logic programming? | Declarative programming that uses code defining facts and rules, with queries used to find answers to problems.
Give an example of a logic language. | Prolog.
What are the four main structures in structured programming? | Sequence, selection, iteration, and recursion.
What is sequence in structured programming? | Code executed line-by-line from top to bottom.
What is selection in structured programming? | A block of code run if a specific condition is met, using IF statements.
What is iteration in structured programming? | A block of code executed a certain number of times or while a condition is met, using FOR, WHILE or REPEAT UNTIL loops.
What is recursion in structured programming? | Functions expressed in terms of themselves, calling themselves until a base case is met.
What is assembly language? | A low-level language that is the next level up from machine code, converted to machine code using an assembler.
What is a mnemonic in assembly language? | An abbreviation for a machine code instruction, making assembly easier to use than binary.
What does the ADD mnemonic do? | Adds the value at the given memory address to the value in the Accumulator.
What does the SUB mnemonic do? | Subtracts the value at the given memory address from the value in the Accumulator.
What does the STA mnemonic do? | Stores the value in the Accumulator at the given memory address.
What does the LDA mnemonic do? | Loads the value at the given memory address into the Accumulator.
What does the INP mnemonic do? | Allows the user to input a value which will be held in the Accumulator.
What does the OUT mnemonic do? | Prints the value currently held in the Accumulator.
What does the HLT mnemonic do? | Stops the program at that line, preventing the rest of the code from executing.
What does the DAT mnemonic do? | Creates a flag with a label at which data is stored.
What does the BRZ mnemonic do? | Branches to a given address if the value in the Accumulator is zero (conditional branch).
What does the BRP mnemonic do? | Branches to a given address if the value in the Accumulator is positive (conditional branch).
What does the BRA mnemonic do? | Branches to a given address regardless of the value in the Accumulator (unconditional branch).
What are the two parts of a machine code instruction? | The opcode and the operand.
What does the opcode specify? | The instruction to be performed.
What does the operand hold? | A value related to the data on which the instruction is to be performed.
What is immediate addressing? | The operand is the actual value upon which the instruction is to be performed, represented in binary.
What is direct addressing? | The operand gives the address which holds the value upon which the instruction is to be performed.
What is indirect addressing? | The operand gives the address of a register which holds another address where the data is located.
What is indexed addressing? | The address of the operand is determined by adding the operand to an index register value.
What is a class in OOP? | A template for an object that defines the state and behaviour of an object.
What are attributes in OOP? | Properties that give an object's state.
What are methods in OOP? | Actions associated with a class that describe what it can perform.
What is instantiation? | The process of creating objects from a class.
What is an object in OOP? | A particular instance of a class.
What is a setter? | A method that sets the value of a particular attribute.
What is a getter? | A method that retrieves the value of a given attribute.
What is encapsulation? | Making attributes private so they can only be altered by public methods, not directly accessed by users.
What is a constructor method? | A method called 'new' that allows a new object to be created.
What is inheritance in OOP? | When a class (subclass) inherits all methods and attributes from another class (superclass) and can have its own additional properties.
What is polymorphism in OOP? | When objects can behave differently depending on their class, with the same method producing different outputs.
What is overriding in polymorphism? | Redefining a method within a subclass so it functions differently and produces a different output.
What is overloading in polymorphism? | Passing different parameters into a method.
Give three advantages of OOP. | High reusability, classes can be used across projects, encapsulation makes code more reliable.
Give three disadvantages of OOP. | Requires different style of thinking, not suited to all problems, generally unsuitable for smaller problems.
Why is assembly language useful for embedded systems? | It allows direct interaction with hardware through the CPU's special purpose registers.
What is the relationship between assembly language instructions and machine code? | Each instruction in assembly language is equivalent to almost one line of machine code.
Why do addressing modes allow for more memory locations? | They prevent the operand size from constraining the number of addresses that can be accessed.
Where is the addressing mode stored? | As part of the opcode.
What type of addressing does LMC use? | Direct addressing.
