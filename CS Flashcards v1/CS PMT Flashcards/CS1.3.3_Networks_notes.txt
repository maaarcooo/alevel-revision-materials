What is a network? | Two or more computers connected together with the ability to transmit data between each other.
What is a LAN? | Local Area Network - a network spread over a small geographical area or single site (e.g., a school).
What is a WAN? | Wide Area Network - a network spread over a large geographical area, often connecting multiple sites.
What is a protocol? | A set of rules defining how two computers communicate with each other.
What does HTTP stand for and what is it used for? | Hypertext Transfer Protocol - used for web page rendering. HTTPS is the encrypted version.
What does TCP/IP stand for? | Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol - used for routing packets through networks.
What are POP3 and IMAP? | Mailing protocols used for email access.
What does FTP stand for and what is it used for? | File Transfer Protocol - used for transmission of files over networks.
What is the Internet? | A network of networks connecting computers globally using large international backbone cables.
What does the Application Layer do in the TCP/IP stack? | Specifies what protocol needs to be used for the application being sent (e.g., HTTP, POP3, FTP).
What does the Transport Layer do in the TCP/IP stack? | Uses TCP to establish end-to-end connection, splits data into packets, labels them with packet number and port number, and requests retransmissions if packets are lost.
What does the Network Layer do in the TCP/IP stack? | Adds source and destination IP addresses; routers use these IP addresses to forward packets.
What is a socket address? | The combination of an IP address and port number.
What does the Link Layer do in the TCP/IP stack? | Adds MAC addresses identifying the Network Interface Cards of source and destination computers.
How are TCP/IP layers processed at the destination? | From bottom to top - MAC address removed by Link Layer, IP addresses removed by Network Layer, port number removed and packets reassembled by Transport Layer, then Application Layer presents the data.
What infrastructure is used in WANs? | Telecommunication hardware owned by third-parties.
What does DNS stand for? | Domain Name System - used to name and organise internet resources.
What does TLD stand for? | Top Level Domain (e.g., .uk, .com).
What does 2LD stand for? | 2nd Level Domain (e.g., gov in leeds.gov.uk).
What is the role of a DNS server? | To translate domain names into IP addresses when accessing websites.
What information is in a packet header? | Sender and recipient IP addresses, protocol being used, order of packets, and Time To Live (TTL).
What is in a packet payload? | The raw data to be transmitted.
What is in a packet trailer? | A checksum or cyclic redundancy check to detect transmission errors.
What is Time To Live (TTL)? | A value that tells the packet when to expire so it doesn't travel forever.
What is packet switching? | A method where data is sent as packets across the most efficient route, which can vary for each packet.
What is an advantage of packet switching? | Multiple routes available; if one path breaks, another can be used. Data can be transferred over very large networks.
What is a disadvantage of packet switching? | Time spent deconstructing and reconstructing packets; must wait for all packets to arrive before data can be received.
What is circuit switching? | A method where a direct link is created between two devices and maintained for the entire conversation.
What is an advantage of circuit switching? | Data arrives in logical order, resulting in quicker reconstruction; enables calls without delay in speech.
What are disadvantages of circuit switching? | Bandwidth wasted when no data sent; devices must transfer at same rate; ties up network sections; electrical interference can corrupt data.
What is a firewall? | A device designed to prevent unauthorised access to a network by comparing packets against preconfigured rules (packet filters).
What does packet filtering examine? | Source IP, destination IP, protocols being used, and ports being requested.
What's the difference between dropped and rejected packets? | Rejected packets send an alert to the sender; dropped packets do not.
What is a proxy server? | An intermediary that collects and sends data on behalf of the user.
What are benefits of using proxies? | User privacy and anonymity, caching frequently used website data for faster loading, reduced web traffic, and blocking access to sensitive sites.
What is encryption? | A way of keeping data secure during transmission by making it unreadable if intercepted, using encryption keys.
What is a Network Interface Card (NIC)? | A card (usually built into devices) that connects a device to a network and assigns a unique MAC address.
What is a MAC address? | A 48-bit value coded into the device, written as a twelve-digit hexadecimal number, uniquely identifying each device.
What is a switch? | A device used to direct the flow of data across a network, commonly used in star topology networks.
What is a Wireless Access Point (WAP)? | A device that allows devices to connect to a network, commonly combined with a router. Used in mesh networks.
What is a router? | A device used to connect two or more networks together, allowing private networks to connect to the Internet.
What is a gateway? | A device that translates protocols between networks when they are not the same, enabling communication.
How does a gateway work? | By removing headers from packets and adding the data to packets using the new protocol.
What is a client-server network? | A network where terminals (clients) are connected to a powerful central computer (server) that holds important information and resources.
What are advantages of client-server networks? | More secure (data in one location), central backups (no individual backups needed), data and resources can be shared between clients.
What are disadvantages of client-server networks? | Relatively expensive to set up, functionality depends on server (if it fails, performance falls), trained staff required to maintain server.
What is a peer-to-peer network? | A network where computers are connected to each other to share files, with each device acting as both server and client.
What are advantages of peer-to-peer networks? | Cheaper to set up, allows resource sharing, easy to maintain, not dependent on central server, specialist staff not required.
What are disadvantages of peer-to-peer networks? | Impossible to trace origin of files, backups must be performed separately, poorer security, may be difficult to locate resources.
