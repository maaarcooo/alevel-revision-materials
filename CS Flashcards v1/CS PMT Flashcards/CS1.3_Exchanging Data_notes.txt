What is symmetric encryption? | An encryption method where the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt data. The key must be shared between both parties.
What is asymmetric encryption? | An encryption method using a public key (available to everyone) to encrypt data and a paired private key (known only by recipient) to decrypt it.
What is hashing? | A one-way transformation of data into an abbreviated hash value, used to validate credentials like passwords without revealing the original data.
What is lossless compression? | A compression algorithm that retains all data by storing only the instructions needed to reconstruct the original file. No data is lost.
What is lossy compression? | A compression algorithm that removes non-essential data, leading to decreased accuracy. Lost data cannot be recovered.
What is run-length encoding (RLE)? | A lossless compression method where repeated data occurrences (like pixels of the same colour) are stored as single values with their counts.
What is dictionary coding? | A lossless compression method where text entries matching a dictionary are substituted with unique codes that can be translated back.
What does atomicity mean in databases? | All transactions must either fully succeed or fully fail, never being only partially processed.
What does consistency mean in databases? | Each transaction must obey the database's validation rules to maintain referential integrity.
What does isolation mean in databases? | No transaction should overwrite other simultaneous transactions. Results must be identical whether transactions run concurrently or sequentially.
What does durability mean in databases? | Once a transaction has begun, it must be completed under all circumstances.
What is a flat file database? | A database using a single table structure to store all data.
What is a relational database? | A database where separate tables are made for each entity, with relationships between entities represented by foreign keys.
What is a primary key? | A unique identifier that identifies each record in a table.
What is a foreign key? | A linking attribute that joins two tables by being a primary key in one table and a foreign key in the other.
What is a secondary key? | An alternative index used to access or sort records more quickly than the primary key, but less accurately.
What is normalisation? | The formal process of optimally designing data tables by reducing redundancy and repetition by converting them into normal forms.
What is First Normal Form (1NF)? | A table with no repeating attributes where each record-attribute intersection produces exactly one value.
What is Second Normal Form (2NF)? | A table in 1NF with repeating data removed into separate tables with appropriate relationships (no partial dependencies).
What is Third Normal Form (3NF)? | A table in 2NF where all non-primary key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key (no non-key dependencies).
What is referential integrity? | Keeping a database consistent by ensuring changes to data or relationships in one table are accounted for in all linked tables.
What is redundancy in databases? | The unnecessary repetition of a field in multiple tables. Controlled redundancy (backups) is beneficial for recovery.
What is indexing? | Creating an index of primary keys so any record's location can be quickly retrieved using its primary key.
What is record locking? | A technique preventing simultaneous access to data by locking a record during editing or updating to prevent inconsistencies.
What is transaction processing? | Ensuring any database operation conforms to ACID rules (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for reliable processing.
What is entity-relationship modelling? | A method of visually describing data tables and their relationships to reduce redundancy and construct a relational database.
What is a Local Area Network (LAN)? | A network connecting computing devices within a single geographical area or site.
What is a Wide Area Network (WAN)? | A network connecting computing devices over a large geographical area, typically using third-party carriers.
What is a client-server network? | A network where client computers connect to powerful central servers that handle service requests and resources.
What is a peer-to-peer network? | A network where computers connect directly to each other and share resources without any central server.
What is circuit switching? | A data transmission method creating a dedicated communication channel first, with all data following the same path throughout communication.
What is packet switching? | A data transmission method breaking data into packets that are sent independently and reassembled at the destination.
What is the TCP/IP stack? | A suite of networking protocols consisting of 4 connected layers that allow networked computers to communicate.
What is the Domain Name System (DNS)? | A hierarchical naming system that maps human-readable domain names to IP addresses on a network.
What is encryption in networks? | Converting original data (plaintext) into an unreadable form (ciphertext) using an encryption algorithm to prevent unauthorised access.
What is a firewall? | A security application monitoring network traffic to prevent unauthorised access between networks.
What is a proxy server? | A server that intercepts data packets to hide true network addresses, restrict access, and isolate networks from external networks.
What is protocol layering? | Simplifying network design by dividing it into functional layers, each with assigned protocols to perform tasks and communicate with adjacent layers.
What is HTML? | HyperText Markup Language - a markup language used to write webpage content on the World Wide Web.
What is CSS? | Cascading Style Sheets - a style language defining the layout, design and presentation of webpages.
What is JavaScript? | An interpreted, object-oriented programming language creating interactive elements and adding functionality to dynamic webpages.
What is client-side processing? | Data processing performed by the client's browser using the user's local computer resources, typically for less critical code.
What is server-side processing? | Data processing performed by the web server, where data is sent from the client for secure processing and results returned to the client.
What is the PageRank algorithm? | Google's algorithm ranking websites by usefulness, based on counting the number of links to that webpage.
What is search engine indexing? | Collecting, parsing and storing data from websites to enable fast and accurate information retrieval by search engines.
