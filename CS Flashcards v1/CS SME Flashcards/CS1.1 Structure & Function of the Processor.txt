What is the primary function of the CPU? | Processing all data within the computer.
Name the three main components of the CPU. | Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit (CU), and Registers.
What are registers? | Temporary storage locations inside the CPU used for specific purposes, faster than RAM.
What does the ALU do? | Performs arithmetic calculations (e.g. binary addition) and logic comparisons (AND, OR, NOT).
What is the function of the Control Unit (CU)? | Decodes instructions and controls data movement within the CPU.
What does the Program Counter (PC) store? | The address in memory of the next instruction to be fetched.
What is stored in the Accumulator (ACC)? | Temporarily stores values after input, loading, or ALU calculations.
What does the Memory Address Register (MAR) store? | Addresses of where data is being sent to or fetched from in memory.
What does the Memory Data Register (MDR) store? | Data or instructions before being sent to memory or after being fetched.
What is the Current Instruction Register (CIR) used for? | Stores fetched instructions before they are split into opcode and operand, then decoded.
Name the four components that make up the ALU. | Arithmetic circuit, logic circuit, registers, and status flags.
What are status flags in the ALU? | Indicators such as overflow flags (value too large) or zero flags (result is zero).
Name the three buses connecting the CPU to main memory. | Data bus, address bus, and control bus.
What does the data bus carry? | Data being sent to/from the CPU and RAM (read/write operations).
What does the address bus carry? | Addresses being sent to/from the CPU and RAM (read/write operations).
What does the control bus do? | Sends signals to determine whether other buses are in read or write mode.
What is the fetch-decode-execute cycle? | The process the CPU repeatedly goes through to process instructions.
Name the three stages of the FDE cycle. | Fetch, Decode, and Execute.
What happens during the Fetch stage? | The instruction address is supplied and the instruction is retrieved from memory.
What happens during the Decode stage? | The instruction is interpreted and required data is retrieved from their addresses.
What happens during the Execute stage? | The CPU carries out the required action.
In the Fetch stage, what is the PC initially loaded with? | 0 (zero).
During Fetch, where is the PC value copied to? | The Memory Address Register (MAR).
What happens to the PC after an instruction is fetched? | It is incremented by 1.
During Decode, where is data sent from the MDR? | To the Current Instruction Register (CIR) where it's split into opcode and operand.
After splitting in the CIR, where is the instruction sent? | To the Control Unit (CU) to be decoded.
During Execute, which register stores an inputted value (INP)? | The Accumulator (ACC).
During Execute, where does an outputted value (OUT) come from? | The current value in the Accumulator (ACC).
When loading a value from RAM (LDA), which path does data follow? | From RAM across the data bus to the MDR (using the address in the MAR).
When storing a value (STA), what is the sequence? | Value from ACC → MDR → data bus → RAM (to address in MAR).
Where are ADD/SUB operations performed? | In the ALU, with the result stored in the ACC.
Where do branch comparisons (BRA/BRZ/BRP) take place? | In the ALU.
Name three ways to measure CPU performance. | Clock speed, number of cores, and cache size.
What is a state change in CPU clock cycles? | When the clock changes from 0 to 1 to 0, representing one cycle.
What is clock speed? | The number of state changes the CPU performs per second, measured in Hz.
What does 2.3 GHz mean? | 2,300,000,000 cycles per second (over 2 billion cycles per second).
How does higher clock speed affect performance? | More instructions executed per second, allowing tasks to complete more quickly.
What is a core? | A processing unit within the CPU.
What is parallel processing? | When multiple cores each carry out separate tasks simultaneously.
Is a dual core processor twice as fast as a single core? | No, because time is spent organising tasks between cores.
What is cache? | Part of primary storage used to store frequently used data and instructions.
Why is cache faster than RAM? | It's closer to the CPU (some cache is within each core).
How does more cache improve CPU performance? | More data can be stored, reducing the need to access slower RAM.
Name the three levels of cache. | Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.
Which cache level is fastest? | Level 1 (closest to the CPU core).
What is pipelining? | Carrying out multiple instructions concurrently, each at different stages of the FDE cycle.
How does pipelining work? | One instruction is fetched while another is decoded and a third is executed simultaneously.
What happens to the pipeline during a branch instruction? | The pipeline is flushed.
How does pipelining reduce latency? | The CPU is not idle while waiting for the next instruction.
What is the efficiency benefit of pipelining? | All parts of the processor can be used at any time.
What is computer architecture? | How a computer uses components and instructions to make the system function.
Name the two common types of computer architecture. | Von Neumann architecture and Harvard architecture.
What type of memory organisation does Von Neumann architecture use? | Unified memory (single memory for both data and instructions).
How many buses does Von Neumann architecture have? | A single shared bus system.
Where is Von Neumann architecture commonly used? | Most modern computers and microcontrollers.
What type of memory organisation does Harvard architecture use? | Separated memory (separate memory for data and instructions).
How many bus systems does Harvard architecture have? | Separate bus systems (distinct buses for data and instructions).
Where is Harvard architecture commonly used? | Specialised embedded systems.
In Von Neumann architecture, how are data and instructions stored? | In the same memory in the same format.
What are the three types of buses in Von Neumann architecture? | Data bus, address bus, and control bus.
What is the main advantage of Harvard architecture's separate memories? | Data and instructions can be fetched simultaneously without interference.
How do separate buses improve Harvard architecture performance? | Data transfers don't interfere with instruction fetches, improving overall performance.
Name three features that help Harvard architecture improve performance over Von Neumann. | Two separate memory areas, different sets of buses, and pipelining capability.
What is hyper-threading? | When a physical core can act as two virtual cores.
What is out of order execution? | Instructions can be executed before earlier ones if they are ready.
What is super scalar execution? | Multiple instructions can be executed simultaneously.
What is a performance boosting mode? | Temporarily increasing clock speed for a performance boost.
What benefit does onboard graphics provide? | Built-in circuitry for graphics processing, reducing load on the main CPU.
