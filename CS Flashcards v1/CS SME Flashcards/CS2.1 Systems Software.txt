# 2.1 Systems Software Flashcards

What is the main purpose of an operating system? | To manage hardware and software resources and provide an interface between the user and hardware.
List the 7 main functions of an operating system. | Resource management, file management, interrupt handling, security, providing a platform for software, providing a user interface, providing utilities.
What does resource management in an OS involve? | Managing CPU, memory, disk drives, and printers by allocating resources to tasks and ensuring efficient use.
What are the two types of user interface provided by operating systems? | GUI (Graphical User Interface) and CLI (Command-Line Interface).
Name 3 utility programs provided by operating systems. | File encryption, file compression, disk defragmentation, system backup, disk cleanup.
What is the purpose of disk defragmentation? | To physically reorganise files on the hard disk so they can be found and accessed faster.
What does file encryption utility do? | Encodes files to allow secure transmission over networks.
What is the purpose of disk cleanup? | Scans the hard disk for duplicate and corrupt files and deletes them to free up space.
What are the 3 memory management techniques? | Paging, segmentation, and virtual memory.
What is paging? | A method of dividing primary memory into fixed-sized blocks (pages) of equal size.
What is internal fragmentation? | Wasted space within a page when data doesn't fill the entire page, which cannot be used by other data.
What is segmentation? | A method of dividing memory into variable-sized blocks that correspond to different types of data needed by an application.
What is external fragmentation? | Physical gaps in memory that reduce the maximum size of new segments that can be allocated.
What is virtual memory? | Secondary storage used as an extension of primary memory when the system is running low on RAM.
What is the main benefit of virtual memory? | Creates an illusion of larger memory and enables multitasking when RAM is limited.
What is the main drawback of virtual memory? | Accessing data in virtual memory is considerably slower than accessing RAM.
What is the benefit of paging? | Facilitates efficient memory management and enables the use of virtual memory.
What is the drawback of paging? | Can lead to internal fragmentation.
What is the benefit of segmentation? | Space-efficient as it only allocates space based on actual need, allowing intuitive memory access.
What is the drawback of segmentation? | Can result in external fragmentation.
What is an interrupt? | A signal to the processor that stops its current task to perform a different, often time-sensitive, task temporarily.
What are the 3 types of interrupts? | Hardware interrupts, software interrupts, and trap interrupts.
Give an example of a hardware interrupt. | Keyboard input, mouse movements, disk I/O requests.
Give an example of a software interrupt. | Application requests to open a file, division by zero errors.
What is an ISR? | Interrupt Service Routine - a special function that handles a particular interrupt type.
List the 5 steps in the interrupt process. | 1) Interrupt request, 2) Interrupt acknowledge, 3) ISR lookup, 4) ISR execution, 5) Interrupt exit.
What happens during the interrupt acknowledge stage? | The interrupt handler decides if the interrupt needs immediate attention, and if yes, saves the current processor register contents to memory.
What is interrupt priority? | The processor's ability to acknowledge and switch to resolving higher-priority interrupts over lower-priority ones.
What is interrupt nesting? | The ability of the processor to handle interrupts within interrupts.
What is the difference between pre-emptive and non-pre-emptive scheduling? | Pre-emptive allocates CPU for time-limited slots and can interrupt processes; non-pre-emptive allocates unlimited time until completion.
What is Round Robin (RR) scheduling? | A pre-emptive algorithm that equally distributes processor time, giving each process a time quantum to execute.
What is First Come First Served (FCFS) scheduling? | A non-pre-emptive algorithm that prioritises processes that arrive at the queue first.
What is Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduling? | A pre-emptive priority algorithm where shorter and more critical tasks are processed first using multiple queues.
What is Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling? | A non-pre-emptive algorithm where processes are sorted by burst time from shortest to longest.
What is Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) scheduling? | A pre-emptive version of SJF where processes with the shortest remaining time have higher priority.
What is the main benefit of Round Robin? | All processes get a fair share of the CPU and it's predictable.
What is the main drawback of Round Robin? | Can lead to high turnaround time and waiting time for long processes.
What is the main drawback of FCFS? | Can lead to poor performance if a long process arrives before shorter processes.
What is the main benefit of SJF? | Minimises waiting time and is efficient for short processes.
What is the main drawback of SJF? | Requires knowing burst time in advance and long processes can starve.
What is a distributed operating system? | An OS that runs on multiple machines appearing as a single unit, used for efficient task distribution.
What is an embedded operating system? | An OS designed for specific tasks, running inside a device that is not primarily a computer (e.g., microwave, dishwasher).
What is a multi-tasking operating system? | An OS that allows multiple tasks to run concurrently on a single processor.
What is a multi-user operating system? | An OS that supports multiple users accessing computer resources concurrently.
What is a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)? | An OS designed for immediate data processing that ensures tasks are processed within specific timeframes.
Give an example of when RTOS would be used. | Self-driving cars, aerospace systems, or any application where low latency is critical to safety.
Give an example of an embedded OS use. | IoT devices, microwaves, washing machines, dishwashers.
What does BIOS stand for? | Basic Input/Output System.
Where is BIOS stored? | On a small memory chip on the motherboard.
What is POST? | Power-On Self-Test - a diagnostic testing sequence that ensures hardware components are working properly.
What happens after a successful POST? | BIOS runs the Bootstrap loading sequence to start the operating system.
What happens if BIOS is destroyed or overwritten? | The computer cannot perform POST or load the bootstrap program, so the operating system fails to start.
What is a device driver? | Software that enables communication between an operating system and specific hardware devices.
Give 3 examples of hardware that requires device drivers. | Printers, graphics cards, network cards.
Why are device drivers necessary? | They bridge the gap between the major operating system and embedded system software in hardware devices.
What is a virtual machine (VM)? | A software-driven computer that runs within a physical machine, mimicking a complete computer system.
What is a hypervisor? | Software that allows a physical machine to run multiple virtual machines.
What is intermediate code? | Code (like Java bytecode) that is compiled from source code and can be executed by a virtual machine on multiple platforms.
Name 3 uses of virtual machines. | Cross-platform compatibility, software testing, legacy support.
What is the main benefit of VMs for testing? | They provide isolated, safe test environments that don't affect the host OS.
What is the main drawback of VMs? | They use system resources from the host machine and performance is slower than running directly on hardware.
How do VMs enable cross-platform compatibility? | They allow software designed for one OS to run on a different OS (e.g., MacOS apps on Windows).
Why might developers use VMs for legacy support? | To run older applications that only work on previous versions of operating systems.
What resources do VMs share with the host OS? | CPU, RAM (memory), and storage.
What is a risk of over-using VMs? | Exhausting the host OS of CPU, memory, and hard disk resources, potentially causing crashes or lag.
