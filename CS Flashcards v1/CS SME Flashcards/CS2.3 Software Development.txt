What is the Waterfall Model? | A sequential software development process divided into distinct phases, where each phase must be completed before the next one begins.
What are the 6 phases of the Waterfall Model in order? | 1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis, 2. System Design, 3. Implementation, 4. Integration and Testing, 5. Deployment, 6. Maintenance.
What happens in the Requirement Gathering and Analysis phase? | All possible system requirements are captured and documented clearly.
What happens in the System Design phase? | Requirements are translated into a design, defining the overall architecture and identifying main components.
What are 3 benefits of the Waterfall Model? | 1. Simple and linear - easy to understand, 2. Clear stages and milestones, 3. Suitable for well-defined projects.
What are 3 drawbacks of the Waterfall Model? | 1. Inflexible - changes are difficult once started, 2. Expensive to fix late problems, 3. Long development cycle.
When is the Waterfall Model most suitable? | For projects where requirements are well understood and unlikely to change, and where high quality and compliance are essential.
What is Agile (Extreme Programming)? | A software development methodology that promotes adaptability and high customer involvement through iterative development.
What is a sprint in Agile? | A short time-boxed development period, usually 1-4 weeks, where specific tasks are completed.
What are user stories in Agile? | Requirements written from the user's perspective (e.g. "As a user, I want to...").
What are the main phases in an Agile sprint cycle? | Plan sprint → Design solution → Develop features → Test continuously → Review progress → Reflect on process → Release → Repeat.
What is pair programming? | A practice where developers work in pairs or small teams to write code together.
What are 4 benefits of Agile/XP? | 1. Highly adaptable to changes, 2. Frequent communication, 3. Quality focus with continuous testing, 4. Customer collaboration.
What are 4 drawbacks of Agile/XP? | 1. Requires experienced team members, 2. Intensive collaboration can lead to burnout, 3. May lack documentation, 4. Scope creep.
What is scope creep? | When the flexible nature of development leads to uncontrolled changes in requirements.
When is Extreme Programming most suitable? | For small to medium-sized projects where requirements can change and customer involvement is high.
What is the Spiral Model? | A software development methodology that combines aspects of both iterative (agile) and sequential (waterfall) processes.
What are the 4 stages of the Spiral Model? | 1. Planning, 2. Risk Analysis, 3. Engineering, 4. Evaluation and Feedback. The process repeats in spiral loops.
What happens in the Risk Analysis phase of the Spiral Model? | Identify and assess potential risks, and plan mitigation strategies.
What are 4 benefits of the Spiral Model? | 1. Flexibility for changes, 2. Risk management emphasis, 3. Strong customer involvement, 4. Incremental releases.
What are 4 drawbacks of the Spiral Model? | 1. Complex and harder to manage, 2. Time-consuming, 3. Expensive, 4. Not suitable for small projects.
When is the Spiral Model most suitable? | For large, complex projects where requirements may change and risk management is essential.
What is Rapid Application Development (RAD)? | A software development methodology that emphasises fast and iterative development.
What are the 5 phases of RAD? | 1. Requirement Planning, 2. User Design and Prototyping, 3. Construction/Iterative Development, 4. Cutover/Deployment, 5. Maintenance and Updates.
What happens in the User Design and Prototyping phase of RAD? | Collaborate with users to develop prototypes, ensuring alignment with user needs.
What are 4 benefits of RAD? | 1. Speed - rapid development, 2. User involvement throughout, 3. Flexibility for changes, 4. Incremental development with feedback.
What are 4 drawbacks of RAD? | 1. Dependent on strong team collaboration, 2. Potential lack of quality due to speed focus, 3. Not suitable for small projects, 4. Can lead to scope creep.
When is RAD most suitable? | For projects where rapid delivery is required and requirements can be developed and refined on the go.
Which model is best for well-defined projects with stable requirements? | Waterfall Lifecycle.
Which model is best for fast-paced projects with changing requirements? | Agile (XP).
Which model is best for complex projects needing extensive risk management? | Spiral Model.
Which model is best for projects requiring quick delivery with active user participation? | Rapid Application Development (RAD).
What is the main difference between Waterfall and Agile? | Waterfall is linear and inflexible (all stages completed in sequence), while Agile is iterative and adaptable (repeating cycles with continuous feedback).
What makes the Spiral Model unique compared to other models? | It combines iterative and sequential processes with a strong emphasis on risk analysis at each spiral loop.
Why might Agile be preferred over Waterfall for adding a new feature to existing software? | Agile's flexibility allows for continuous improvements and adjustments during development, while Waterfall's rigid structure makes changes difficult once started.
