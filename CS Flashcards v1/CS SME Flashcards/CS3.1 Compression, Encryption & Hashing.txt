Why is compression needed for data transfer? | To reduce file size for faster transmission and lower bandwidth consumption over the Internet.
What is lossy compression? | A compression method where some data is permanently discarded to greatly reduce file size.
What is lossless compression? | A compression method that maintains original data with no loss, resulting in larger files than lossy.
When should lossy compression be used? | For media streaming where some data loss is acceptable and small file size is prioritised.
When should lossless compression be used? | When data integrity is imperative, such as for text files or archival storage.
What is Run Length Encoding (RLE)? | A compression method that condenses identical consecutive elements into a single value with a count.
Give an example of RLE compression. | "AAAABBBCCDAA" compresses to "4A3B2C1D2A"
What is dictionary coding? | A compression method that replaces recurring sequences with shorter, unique codes using a dictionary.
What is encryption? | Converting readable data into an unreadable format to secure it from unauthorised access.
What is symmetric encryption? | Encryption using the same key for both encrypting and decrypting data.
What is the main advantage of symmetric encryption? | It is fast and efficient for encrypting large amounts of data.
What is the main disadvantage of symmetric encryption? | The challenge of securely sharing the key between sender and receiver.
What is asymmetric encryption? | Encryption using two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
What is the main advantage of asymmetric encryption? | Solves key distribution issues as the public key can be openly shared.
What is the main disadvantage of asymmetric encryption? | It is typically slower than symmetric encryption.
When should symmetric encryption be used? | For large files and databases where the same person encrypts and decrypts.
When should asymmetric encryption be used? | For confidential communications like passwords and government data requiring high security.
What is hashing? | A method to convert any data into a fixed-size string of characters called a digest.
What is a key property of hash functions? | The same input always produces the same hash output (consistency).
What happens if you change one character in hashed data? | It produces a radically different hash output (sensitivity to data changes).
Name three common hashing algorithms. | MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.
Which hashing algorithm is considered most secure? | SHA-256 (part of the SHA-2 family).
Can hashing be reversed? | No, hashing is irreversible (one-way function).
Can encryption be reversed? | Yes, encryption can be decrypted back to original data.
How are passwords typically stored in databases? | As hashed values, not plaintext.
How does password verification work with hashing? | The entered password is hashed and compared against the stored hash.
Why is hashing passwords more secure than storing plaintext? | Even if the database is compromised, attackers cannot use the hashed passwords directly.
Why is hashing efficient for database lookups? | Hash digests have fixed length, making comparisons faster than variable-length strings.
How can hashing verify data integrity? | If two hashes are identical, the data hasn't been altered during transmission.
What is a hash table? | A data structure that uses hash values as keys for efficient data retrieval.
What is the difference between encryption and hashing in terms of keys? | Encryption uses keys; hashing involves no keys.
Which is generally faster: encryption or hashing? | Hashing is generally faster.
What is the main purpose of encryption? | Securing data for transmission or storage (reversible).
What is the main purpose of hashing? | Data verification and quick data retrieval (irreversible).
What are the two types of compression? | Lossy and lossless compression.
What is a benefit of lossy compression? | Greatly reduced file sizes suitable for media streaming.
What is a drawback of lossy compression? | Irreversible loss of data quality; not suitable for text or archival storage.
What is a benefit of lossless compression? | Maintains original data integrity.
What is a drawback of lossless compression? | Larger file sizes than lossy and requires high bandwidth when streaming.
Where is RLE commonly used? | In bitmap images to compress sequences of the same colour.
What does RLE stand for? | Run Length Encoding.
How does dictionary coding work? | It compiles a dictionary to map original sequences to special codes.
Is dictionary coding effective for binary data? | Yes, it is effective for both text and binary data.
What does symmetric encryption use for both operations? | The same key for encryption and decryption.
What keys does asymmetric encryption use? | A public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
Who shares the public key in asymmetric encryption? | The receiver shares it openly.
What is the only key that can decrypt asymmetrically encrypted data? | The receiver's private key.
Where is symmetric encryption ideal? | For encrypting large files or databases within a secure network.
Where is asymmetric encryption preferred? | In situations demanding high security like secure email or online banking.
What is a hash digest? | The fixed-size output produced by a hash function.
Why is SHA-1 now considered weak? | Due to vulnerabilities that make it susceptible to attacks.
What was MD5 used for? | Widely used but now considered weak due to collision attack vulnerabilities.
What is SHA-3? | The most recent member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family for higher security.
Does hashing use keys? | No, hashing involves no keys.
What is the output length of hashing? | Fixed length output regardless of input size.
What is the output length of encryption? | Variable; could be same or longer than input.
What are typical operations for encryption? | Encrypt and Decrypt.
What are typical operations for hashing? | Hash and Verify.
When a user first signs up, what happens to their password? | The password is hashed before storage.
What is stored in the database instead of the plaintext password? | The hashed password.
During login, what is compared? | The hash of the entered password is compared against the stored hash.
What happens if the hashes match during login? | The user is authenticated and granted access.
What happens if the hashes don't match during login? | Access is denied.
Why does hashing minimise risk during data breaches? | Users' raw passwords are not exposed.
How does a good hash function distribute keys? | Uniformly across the hash table for balanced data retrieval.
Why is querying by hash digest more efficient? | Hash digests have fixed length, making comparisons easier than variable-length strings.
How can hashing verify data integrity during network transfer? | By comparing hashes before and after transfer; identical hashes confirm data integrity.
What makes comparing hashes computationally efficient? | Comparing fixed-size hashes is less intensive than string comparison.
What is Moore's Law in relation to compression? | Technology like cameras improve each year and capture more data, requiring compression.
Does a Standard Definition film contain as much data as 4K? | No, it contains less data fundamentally.
What enables cameras to capture more colour and contrast? | New advancements in camera technology.
