What is a database? | An organised collection of data that allows easy storage, retrieval, and management of information.
What is a field in a database? | A single piece of data in a record.
What is a record in a database? | A group of related fields representing one data entry.
What is a table in a database? | A collection of records with a similar structure.
What is a primary key? | A unique identifier for each record in a table, usually an ID number.
What is a compound primary key? | A combination of 2 or more fields that is unique for all records.
What is a foreign key? | A field in a table that refers to the primary key in another table, used to link tables and create relationships.
What is a secondary key? | A field or fields that are indexed for faster searching.
What is a Database Management System (DBMS)? | Software used to manage databases (e.g., MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL).
What is indexing in databases? | A technique used to speed up data retrieval by allowing the DBMS to go directly to relevant records rather than searching every record.
What is a flat file database? | A database that stores all data in a single table.
What are the problems with flat file databases? | Data redundancy, inefficient storage, and harder to maintain.
What is a relational database? | A database that organises data into multiple tables connected by keys.
What are the advantages of relational databases? | Reduces data redundancy, efficient storage, and easier to maintain.
What is normalisation? | The process of organising a database to reduce data duplication and improve data accuracy and consistency.
What are the requirements for First Normal Form (1NF)? | Contains atomic values, no repeating groups, unique column names, and has a primary key.
What does atomic mean in database context? | Each column contains single, indivisible values (not lists or arrays).
What are the requirements for Second Normal Form (2NF)? | Fulfils all 1NF requirements, applies to tables with compound primary keys, has full functional dependency, and no partial dependencies.
What is a partial dependency? | When a non-prime attribute depends on only part of a compound primary key.
What are the requirements for Third Normal Form (3NF)? | Fulfils all 2NF requirements, has no transitive dependencies, and each non-prime attribute depends solely on the primary key.
What is a transitive dependency? | When a non-prime attribute depends on another non-prime attribute rather than directly on the primary key.
What is an entity? | Something worthy of capturing and storing data about (e.g., students, orders, products).
What are the three types of relationships in databases? | One-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.
What is an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)? | A diagram that represents the entities in a database and the relationships between them.
What notation is used to draw relationships in ERDs? | Crow's feet notation.
How do you resolve a many-to-many relationship? | Create a link table (junction table) that goes between the entities.
Which entity in a relationship will have a foreign key? | The entity on the "many" side of a one-to-many relationship.
What is OMR? | Optical Mark Recognition - detects marked areas on paper using a special machine.
What is OCR? | Optical Character Recognition - converts printed or handwritten text into digital format.
What are barcodes used for? | Tracking items, inventory management, and point-of-sale systems.
What is data mining? | The process of discovering hidden patterns, correlations, and insights from large datasets.
What is Query By Example (QBE)? | A user-friendly method for constructing database queries using a visual interface.
What is CSV? | Comma Separated Values - a simple data exchange format that stores tabular data in plain text.
What is JSON? | JavaScript Object Notation - a lightweight data interchange format using key-value pairs.
What is EDI? | Electronic Data Interchange - a standardised electronic communication method for transferring documents between businesses.
What is an API? | Application Programming Interface - protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.
What is SQL? | Structured Query Language - a programming language used to interact with a DBMS.
What does SELECT do in SQL? | Retrieves data from a database table.
What does FROM do in SQL? | Specifies the tables to retrieve data from.
What does WHERE do in SQL? | Filters data based on a specified condition.
What does the wildcard * mean in SQL? | Selects all columns in a table.
What does the wildcard % mean in SQL? | Used with LIKE operator to match any sequence of characters.
What does INSERT do in SQL? | Adds new data to a database table.
What does DELETE do in SQL? | Removes data from a database table.
What does DROP do in SQL? | Deletes an entire table from a database.
What does JOIN do in SQL? | Combines data from two or more tables based on a related column.
What is a nested SELECT in SQL? | A SELECT statement within another SELECT statement.
What is referential integrity? | Ensures consistency between related tables by maintaining valid relationships between primary and foreign keys.
What is CASCADE in referential integrity? | Automatically makes changes to related records when the primary key is updated or deleted.
What is SET NULL in referential integrity? | Sets foreign key values to null in related records when the primary key is deleted.
What is NO ACTION/RESTRICT in referential integrity? | Prevents changes if related records exist.
What is an orphaned record? | A record with a foreign key that doesn't match any primary key in the related table.
What is a transaction? | A sequence of database operations treated as a single unit of work.
What does ACID stand for? | Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
What is Atomicity in ACID? | All operations in a transaction succeed or fail as a whole - no partial transactions.
What is Consistency in ACID? | Data remains in a consistent state after transactions, following all database rules.
What is Isolation in ACID? | Transactions are isolated from each other - intermediate states are not visible to other transactions.
What is Durability in ACID? | Committed transactions persist even in case of system failures.
What is record locking? | A technique to prevent conflicting access to data by multiple transactions.
What is a shared lock? | Allows multiple transactions to read a record simultaneously but prevents modifications.
What is an exclusive lock? | Allows only one transaction to access and modify a record, blocking all other access.
What is redundancy in databases? | When the same piece of data is stored in more than one table, leading to inconsistencies and wasted space.
What is concurrency control? | Manages simultaneous access to data in a multi-user environment using techniques like locking and timestamping.
