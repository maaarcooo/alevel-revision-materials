What are line spectra? | Series of lines produced when excited atoms emit light of certain wavelengths corresponding to specific electron transitions
Another name for line spectra is what? | Atomic spectra
Why does each element produce a unique set of spectral lines? | Each element has unique energy level spacings, so transitions produce unique wavelengths
What are the two types of line spectra? | Emission spectra and absorption spectra
What is an emission spectrum? | Light emitted when electrons transition from higher to lower energy levels, appearing as bright lines on a dark background
What is an absorption spectrum? | A continuous spectrum with dark lines at specific wavelengths where light has been absorbed
What does an absorption spectrum consist of? | A continuous spectrum containing all colours with dark lines at specific wavelengths
Why do dark lines appear in an absorption spectrum? | Specific wavelengths are absorbed and re-emitted in random directions rather than the original direction
How do the wavelengths in an absorption spectrum relate to the emission spectrum of the same element? | The wavelengths missing from an absorption spectrum are the same as the emission spectrum wavelengths

What is the threshold frequency? | The minimum frequency of light required to cause photoelectron emission
What provides evidence for the wave nature of light? | Diffraction and interference (Young's Double-Slit Experiment)
What happens when waves pass through a gap or around an obstacle? | Diffraction occurs — the wave spreads out
Why does the wave theory of light fail to explain the photoelectric effect? | It predicts any frequency could cause emission with long exposure, but emission only occurs above the threshold frequency
According to wave theory, how would energy be absorbed by electrons? | Gradually, with each wave
What actually happens to energy absorption in the photoelectric effect? | Energy is absorbed instantaneously
If light intensity increases above threshold frequency, what happens to photoelectrons? | More photoelectrons are emitted per second, but their maximum kinetic energy remains unchanged
Who discovered that matter can behave as a wave? | Louis de Broglie
What pattern is produced when a beam of electrons passes through a thin crystal or graphite film? | A diffraction pattern
Why is graphite film ideal for electron diffraction experiments? | Its crystalline structure has gaps between atomic planes that act as slits
What shape is the electron diffraction pattern observed on screen? | Concentric rings
If electrons behaved only as particles, how would they be distributed on the screen? | Uniformly, rather than forming a ring pattern
How does a larger accelerating voltage affect the diameter of diffraction rings? | It reduces the diameter (shorter wavelength)
How does a lower accelerating voltage affect the diameter of diffraction rings? | It increases the diameter (longer wavelength)
What equation relates the kinetic energy of electrons to accelerating voltage? | Eₖ = eV

How does increasing the accelerating voltage affect electron wavelength? | Decreases the wavelength
How does increasing the accelerating voltage affect the diffraction rings? | The rings appear closer together (smaller radius)
What can electron diffraction patterns be used to deduce? | The structure of crystals
Why can high energy electrons be used to examine atomic nuclei? | They have shorter wavelengths, allowing examination of smaller structures
What is peer review? | A process where other scientists evaluate theories and research
What does the scientific community assess through peer review? | Validity, originality, and significance of research
What does validity mean in peer review? | Whether the research achieves what it claims, uses appropriate methods, and addresses errors
What does originality mean in peer review? | Whether the results are new or if similar research already exists
What does significance mean in peer review? | Whether the findings are important or ground-breaking
What two qualities should research have besides being peer-reviewed? | Repeatable (by same scientists) and reproducible (by other teams)
What is repeatability in scientific research? | The same scientists can achieve the same results
What is reproducibility in scientific research? | Other teams of scientists can achieve the same results
