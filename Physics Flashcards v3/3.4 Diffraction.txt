What is diffraction? | The spreading out of waves after they pass through a narrow gap or around an obstruction
The spreading out of waves after passing through a narrow gap or around an obstruction — what phenomenon is this? | Diffraction
When are diffraction effects most noticeable? | When the wavelength of the wave and the width of the gap are approximately the same size
What causes the bright fringes in a single slit diffraction pattern? | Constructive interference of each part of the wavefront as it passes through the slit
What causes the dark fringes in a single slit diffraction pattern? | Destructive interference of each part of the wavefront as it passes through the slit
What is the central maximum in single slit diffraction? | The central bright fringe with the greatest intensity of any fringe
How does the central maximum in single slit diffraction compare to other bright fringes? | It is much wider and brighter than the other bright fringes
How does the central maximum in single slit diffraction compare to double slit diffraction? | The single slit central maximum is much wider than that of the double slit pattern
What happens to the intensity of subsidiary maxima as distance from the centre increases in single slit diffraction? | The intensity decreases with distance from the centre
What is the intensity at dark fringes in single slit diffraction? | Zero intensity
Why is the central maximum white when white light passes through a single slit? | Constructive interference occurs for all wavelengths at the centre
What do the non-central maxima look like when white light is diffracted through a single slit? | They are composed of a spectrum
Which colour appears nearest to the central maximum in white light diffraction? | Violet/blue (shortest wavelength)
Why does violet/blue light appear nearest to the central maximum in white light diffraction? | Because it is diffracted less (shorter wavelength)
Which colour appears furthest from the central maximum in white light diffraction? | Red (longest wavelength)
Why does red light appear furthest from the central maximum in white light diffraction? | Because it is diffracted more (longer wavelength)
What happens to the fringe spacing as distance from the centre increases in white light diffraction? | The fringe spacing gets smaller, eventually causing spectra to merge
How does the double slit interference pattern differ from the single slit pattern in terms of intensity peaks? | Double slit has equally spaced peaks with approximately equal brightness; single slit has a distinctive central maximum with decreasing intensity maxima
When is diffraction most significant in terms of gap width? | When the wavelength is similar to or greater than the gap size
What happens to the diffraction pattern when the slit width is reduced? | More diffraction occurs, the angle of diffraction increases, and the width of bright maxima increases
What happens to the fringes when slits are made wider? | The fringes become narrower
What happens to the fringes when slits are made narrower? | The fringes become wider
How does wavelength affect the diffraction pattern? | Longer wavelength produces more diffraction and wider fringes
What happens to the diffraction pattern if a blue laser is replaced with a red laser? | The fringes become wider and the central maximum increases in width
What is a diffraction grating? | A piece of optical equipment consisting of many parallel, equally spaced slits cut into a glass plate
A piece of optical equipment with many parallel, equally spaced slits cut into a glass plate — what is this called? | A diffraction grating
What does a diffraction grating separate monochromatic light into? | Bright and dark fringes
What does a diffraction grating separate white light into? | Its different wavelength components
Why are diffraction gratings useful compared to a double slit? | They create a sharper pattern with narrower and brighter bright fringes and darker dark regions
State the diffraction grating equation | d sin θ = nλ

In the equation d sin θ = nλ, what does θ represent? | The angle of diffraction of the light of order n from the normal
In the equation d sin θ = nλ, what does n represent? | The order of the maximum (n = 0, 1, 2, 3...)
In the equation d sin θ = nλ, what does λ represent? | The wavelength of the light from the source (in metres)
How do you calculate slit spacing d from N (number of lines per unit length)? | d = 1/N
If a diffraction grating has N lines per mm, what units will the slit spacing d have? | Millimetres (mm)
If a diffraction grating has N lines per m, what units will the slit spacing d have? | Metres (m)
How do you calculate the angular separation of each maxima? | sin θ = nλ/d
What happens to angular separation as the order of maxima increases? | Angular separation increases
How do you find the angular separation between two different order maxima? | Subtract the smaller angle from the larger angle (e.g., θ₂ − θ₁)
What is the maximum angle of diffraction at which maxima can be seen? | When the beam is at right angles to the grating (θ = 90°)
How do you calculate the maximum order of maxima visible? | n = d/λ (rounded down to the nearest integer)
Why must the maximum order n be rounded down? | Because n must be an integer (whole number of wavelengths)
For the first order maximum (n = 1), what is sin θ₁ equal to? | λ/d
For the second order maximum (n = 2), what is sin θ₂ equal to? | 2λ/d
For the nth order maximum, what is sin θₙ equal to? | nλ/d
What does the zero order maximum (n = 0) represent? | The central maximum where θ = 0° (light passes straight through)

What is the relationship between gap width and wavelength for maximum diffraction? | Maximum diffraction occurs when gap width approximately equals wavelength
