What are the two types that all physical quantities can be classified as? | Scalar or vector
What is a scalar quantity? | A quantity that has magnitude but no direction
A quantity that has magnitude but no direction is called what? | A scalar quantity
What is a vector quantity? | A quantity that has both magnitude and direction
A quantity that has both magnitude and direction is called what? | A vector quantity
Is mass a scalar or vector quantity? | Scalar (has magnitude but no direction)
Is weight a scalar or vector quantity? | Vector (has both magnitude and direction)
Why is weight a vector quantity? | Because it is a force and has both magnitude and direction
What is distance? | A measure of how far an object has travelled, regardless of direction
Is distance a scalar or vector quantity? | Scalar
Why is distance a scalar quantity? | Because it has magnitude but no direction
What does distance measure in terms of path? | The total length of the path taken

In vector subtraction c = a - b, what must be done to vector b first? | Reverse its direction to make -b
What does resolving a vector mean? | Breaking a single vector down into two perpendicular components
What are the parts called when a vector is broken down? | Components
What is the horizontal component of a force F at angle θ to the horizontal? | Fₓ = F cos θ
What is the vertical component of a force F at angle θ to the horizontal? | Fᵧ = F sin θ
What is an inclined plane? | A flat surface tilted at an angle θ
For an object on an inclined plane, what component of weight acts perpendicular to the slope? | W cos θ (or mg cos θ)
For an object on an inclined plane, what component of weight acts parallel to the slope? | W sin θ (or mg sin θ)
On a frictionless inclined plane, what force causes the object to move down the slope? | The parallel component of weight: W sin θ
On an inclined plane, what is the normal reaction force R equal to? | W cos θ (the perpendicular component of weight)
Why does the normal force equal W cos θ on an inclined plane? | Because the object is not moving perpendicular to the slope, so forces in that direction are balanced
What are the two conditions for forces to be in equilibrium? | The object is at rest OR moving at constant velocity
How are coplanar forces in equilibrium represented graphically? | By a closed vector triangle
What does it mean for vectors to form a closed path? | When joined together head-to-tail, they return to the starting point
What are the four most common forces acting on objects? | Weight, normal reaction force, tension, and friction
For an object in equilibrium, what must the vector sum of all forces equal? | Zero (the vectors form a closed triangle)
Which trigonometric function relates opposite and adjacent sides? | Tangent (tan θ = opposite/adjacent)
Which trigonometric function relates adjacent and hypotenuse? | Cosine (cos θ = adjacent/hypotenuse)
