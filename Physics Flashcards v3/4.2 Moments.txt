What is a moment? | The turning effect of a force
The turning effect of a force — what is this called? | A moment
When do moments occur? | When forces cause objects to rotate about some pivot
What is the equation for the moment of a force? | Moment = Force × perpendicular distance from the pivot
What is the SI unit for moment? | Newton metres (N m)
What alternative unit may be used for moment? | Newton centimetres (N cm)
If a force is not perpendicular to the distance from the pivot, how is the moment calculated? | Moment = F × d cos(θ), where θ is the angle between the force and the perpendicular
Why is a door handle placed far from the hinge? | To maximise the distance from the pivot, providing a greater moment for a given force
What does the principle of moments state? | For a system to be in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about a point equals the sum of anticlockwise moments about the same point
For a system in equilibrium, what condition must be met regarding moments? | Sum of clockwise moments = sum of anticlockwise moments (about the same point)
What is a couple in physics? | A pair of equal and opposite coplanar forces that acts to produce rotation only
A pair of equal and opposite coplanar forces producing rotation only — what is this called? | A couple
What three properties must forces in a couple have? | Equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, perpendicular to the distance between them
What is the resultant force produced by a couple? | Zero
Why does an object acted on by a couple not accelerate linearly? | The resultant force is zero, so by F = ma, there is no linear acceleration
Does the moment of a couple depend on a pivot point? | No, unlike single force moments, it does not depend on a pivot
What is the equation for the moment of a couple? | Moment = Force × perpendicular distance between the lines of action of the forces
What is a line of action of a force? | The line through the point at which the force is applied, in the direction of the force
Can the two forces of a couple share the same line of action? | No, they must have different lines of action
What is the centre of mass of an object? | The point at which the weight of the object may be considered to act
The point at which the weight of an object may be considered to act — what is this called? | Centre of mass
Where is the centre of mass of a uniform regular solid located? | At its centre
Where is the centre of mass of a sphere? | At its centre
Where is the centre of mass located for symmetrical objects with uniform density? | At the point of symmetry
How does the position of the centre of mass affect an object? | It affects its stability
When is an object stable? | When its centre of mass lies above its base
What happens to stability if an object's centre of mass moves outside its base? | The object will topple
How does a wider base affect centre of mass and stability? | A wider base results in a lower centre of mass and greater stability
How does a narrower base affect centre of mass and stability? | A narrower base results in a higher centre of mass and the object is more likely to topple
What two features do the most stable objects have? | Wide bases and low centres of mass
Can the centre of mass lie outside a body? | Yes, since it is a hypothetical point, it can lie inside or outside the body
Does the centre of mass of an object change? | Yes, it shifts depending on the shape of the body
In a uniform gravitational field, how does the centre of gravity relate to the centre of mass? | They are identical
Does the centre of mass depend on the gravitational field? | No
Does the centre of gravity depend on the gravitational field? | Yes, because weight = mass × acceleration due to gravity
When an object is in space between two bodies, where does its centre of gravity shift? | Towards the object with the larger gravitational field
For a uniform beam, where does its weight act? | At its centre of gravity, which is at the middle of the beam
What must be true about distances when applying the principle of moments? | All distances must be in the same units
What determines whether a moment is clockwise or anticlockwise? | The direction the force would cause the object to rotate about the pivot
