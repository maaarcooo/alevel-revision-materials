What do Newton's laws of motion describe? | The relationship between forces acting on objects and the motion of the objects
State Newton's First Law of Motion | An object will remain at rest or move with constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force
An object will remain at rest or move with constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force — which law is this? | Newton's First Law of Motion
According to Newton's First Law, what happens to an object at rest with no resultant force? | It remains at rest
According to Newton's First Law, what happens to a moving object with no resultant force? | It continues moving at constant velocity
What is required to change the motion of an object? | A resultant force
What three changes to motion can a resultant force cause? | Speed up, slow down, or change direction
If the forces on a body are balanced (resultant force is 0), what are the two possible states of the body? | At rest or moving at constant velocity
Why is it useful to split forces into horizontal and vertical components? | Because force is a vector quantity
If forces are balanced, what is true about horizontal forces? | Forces acting left equal forces acting right
If forces are balanced, what is true about vertical forces? | Forces acting upward equal forces acting downward
What is the resultant force? | The vector sum of all forces acting on a body
The vector sum of all forces acting on a body — what term describes this? | Resultant force
State Newton's Second Law of Motion | The resultant force acting on an object with constant mass is directly proportional to its acceleration
The resultant force on an object with constant mass is directly proportional to its acceleration — which law is this? | Newton's Second Law of Motion
Write the equation for Newton's Second Law | F = ma
In F = ma, what does F represent and what is its unit? | Resultant force, measured in newtons (N)
In F = ma, what does m represent and what is its unit? | Mass of object, measured in kilograms (kg)
In F = ma, what does a represent and what is its unit? | Acceleration, measured in metres per second squared (m s⁻²)
In what direction does acceleration act relative to resultant force? | In the same direction as the resultant force
What happens when unbalanced forces act on an object? | The object experiences a resultant force
If resultant force acts along the direction of motion, what can happen to the object? | It can speed up (accelerate) or slow down (decelerate)
If resultant force acts at an angle to direction of motion, what happens to the object? | It changes direction
What type of quantity is force? | A vector quantity with both magnitude and direction
What two methods can be used to find the magnitude and direction of a resultant force at an angle? | Combining vectors or scale drawings
What type of quantity is acceleration? | A vector quantity with both magnitude and direction
When is acceleration positive? | When the resultant force acts in the direction of the object's motion
When is acceleration negative? | When the resultant force opposes the direction of the object's motion
What happens to a falling object's acceleration if no drag forces are present? | The acceleration is independent of its mass
How can Newton's Second Law be expressed in terms of momentum? | The resultant force equals the rate of change of momentum
The resultant force on an object equals its rate of change of momentum — which law is this? | Newton's Second Law of Motion
Write the equation for momentum | p = mv
Write the equation for rate of change of momentum | Δp/Δt = mΔv/Δt
How is force related to rate of change of velocity? | F = mΔv/Δt
In what direction is the change in momentum relative to resultant force? | In the same direction as the resultant force
What do Newton's First and Second Laws deal with? | Multiple forces acting on a single object
What does Newton's Third Law deal with? | Forces involved when two objects interact
State Newton's Third Law of Motion | If Object A exerts a force on Object B, then Object B will exert a force on Object A which is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction
If Object A exerts a force on Object B, Object B exerts an equal but opposite force on Object A — which law is this? | Newton's Third Law of Motion
What are Newton's Third Law force pairs often called? | Third-law pairs
List the four criteria for a Newton's Third Law force pair | Same type of force, same magnitude, opposite in direction, acting on different objects
For a third-law pair, must the forces be the same type? | Yes
For a third-law pair, what is true about the magnitudes? | They must be equal (same magnitude)
For a third-law pair, what is true about the directions? | They must be opposite
For a third-law pair, must the forces act on the same or different objects? | Different objects
In walking, what force does the foot exert on the ground? | A backward push (normal contact force)
In walking, what force does the ground exert on the foot? | A forward push (normal contact force)
What type of force enables walking according to Newton's Third Law? | Normal contact force (between foot and ground)
What is another name for normal contact force? | Support force or normal reaction force
If you consider the weight of a person, what is its third-law pair? | The gravitational pull of the person on the Earth
Why are weight and normal reaction force NOT a Newton's Third Law pair? | They are different types of force and both act on the same object
What is a common misconception about Newton's First Law? | That a moving object naturally slows down without a force acting on it
What was revolutionary about Newton's First Law when proposed? | It contradicted the belief that moving objects naturally slow down
What is a 'body' in physics terminology? | An object
What direction is generally considered positive for a moving object? | The direction of motion
What directions are generally considered positive for a stationary object? | Forward, upward, and to the right
What does a positive resultant force value indicate? | The force acts in the direction of motion
What does a negative resultant force value indicate? | The force opposes the direction of motion
Does a resultant force opposing motion cause an object to travel backwards? | No, it causes the object to decelerate
A book rests on a table with weight acting down and normal force acting up. Is this Newton's Third Law? | No, these are different force types acting on the same object (Newton's First Law)
For a book on a table, what is the third-law pair for the normal contact force from the table? | The normal contact force from the book pushing on the table
For a book on a table, what is the third-law pair for the Earth's gravitational pull on the book? | The gravitational pull of the book on the Earth
What type of diagram shows multiple forces acting on one object? | A free-body force diagram
Can two forces of equal magnitude in opposite directions always be called a third-law pair? | No, they must also be the same type of force and act on different objects
