## Scalars and Vectors

### Definitions

**Scalars** - quantities with **magnitude only** (no direction)
- Example: mass, distance, speed, time, energy, volume, density, pressure, electric charge, temperature

**Vectors** - quantities with **both magnitude and direction**
- Example: displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, momentum

## Key Scalar and Vector Pairs

| Scalar | Vector |
|--------|--------|
| Distance | Displacement |
| Speed | Velocity |
| Mass | Weight (force) |
| Time | - |
| Energy | - |

### Distance vs Displacement

**Distance**
- Total length of path travelled
- Scalar quantity (magnitude only)
- Always positive

**Displacement**
- Straight line distance from start to finish point, **including direction**
- Vector quantity (magnitude and direction)
- Can be positive or negative

### Speed vs Velocity

**Speed**
- Distance travelled per unit time
- Describes how fast an object is moving
- Scalar quantity

**Velocity**
- Displacement per unit time, including direction
- Describes how fast and in which direction
- Vector quantity
- An object can have constant speed but changing velocity (if direction changes)

## Combining Vectors

### Vector Representation
- Vectors represented by arrows
- **Arrowhead** = direction
- **Length** = magnitude
- **Resultant vector** = combined effect of two or more vectors

### Method 1: Calculation (Perpendicular Vectors Only)

For vectors at **right angles**, use:

**Magnitude** (Pythagoras' Theorem):
$$R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$

**Direction** (Trigonometry):
$$\tan\theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$$

$$\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}\right)$$

### Method 2: Scale Drawing (Non-Perpendicular Vectors)

**Steps:**
1. Link vectors head-to-tail
2. Draw resultant vector (triangle or parallelogram method)
3. Measure length with ruler
4. Measure angle with protractor
5. Convert back using scale (e.g., 1 cm = 2 km)

**Triangle Method:**
1. Link vectors head-to-tail
2. Resultant = tail of first vector to head of second vector

**Parallelogram Method:**
1. Link vectors tail-to-tail
2. Complete the parallelogram
3. Resultant = diagonal of parallelogram

### Vector Addition
- c = a + b
- Link vectors head-to-tail and draw resultant

### Vector Subtraction
- c = a - b
- **First reverse direction of vector b** (to make -b)
- Then add: c = a + (-b)

## Resolving Vectors

### Definition
**Resolving** = splitting a single vector into two perpendicular components

For a vector **F** at angle **θ** to horizontal:

**Horizontal component:**
$$F_x = F\cos\theta$$

**Vertical component:**
$$F_y = F\sin\theta$$

### Memory Aid: "Cos Sandwich"
- **cos θ** is always the **adjacent** side to the angle

---

## Forces on an Inclined Plane

For an object of weight **W = mg** on a slope at angle **θ**:

**Component perpendicular to slope:**
$$W\cos\theta = mg\cos\theta$$

**Component parallel to slope:**
$$W\sin\theta = mg\sin\theta$$

**Key points:**
- Normal reaction force **R = mg cos θ** (perpendicular to slope)
- Force causing motion down slope = **mg sin θ** (parallel to slope)
- If no friction, object accelerates down slope with **a = g sin θ**

---

## Equilibrium

### Conditions for Equilibrium
An object is in equilibrium if it is:
- At rest, OR
- Moving at constant velocity

### Vector Triangles in Equilibrium
- Coplanar forces in equilibrium form a **closed vector triangle**
- Vectors join head-to-tail to form a closed path
- No resultant force

### Common Forces
- **Weight (W)** - downwards
- **Normal reaction (R)** - perpendicular to surface
- **Tension (T)** - along cables/strings
- **Friction (F)** - parallel to surface, opposes motion

## Key Points to Remember

1. **Always identify** whether a quantity is scalar or vector
2. For **perpendicular vectors**, use Pythagoras and trigonometry
3. For **non-perpendicular vectors**, use scale drawings
4. When resolving, **horizontal = F cos θ**, **vertical = F sin θ**
5. In equilibrium, forces form a **closed vector triangle**
6. Vector subtraction requires **reversing the direction** of the subtracted vector
7. On inclined planes, resolve weight **parallel and perpendicular** to the slope

## Common Exam Tips

✓ Draw clear vector diagrams with arrows showing direction
✓ Label all forces and angles
✓ Show your working for calculations
✓ Include units in final answers
✓ For scale drawings, state the scale clearly
✓ Check your answer makes physical sense
✓ Remember: cos θ is the adjacent side ("cos sandwich")
