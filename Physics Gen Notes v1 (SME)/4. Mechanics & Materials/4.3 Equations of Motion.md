# 3.3 Equations of Motion - Revision Notes

## 1. Motion Along a Straight Line

### Scalar and Vector Quantities

**Scalar Quantities** (magnitude only):
- **Distance**: total length between two points
- **Speed**: total distance travelled per unit of time

**Vector Quantities** (magnitude and direction):
- **Displacement**: distance of an object from a fixed point in a specified direction
- **Velocity**: rate of change of displacement
- **Acceleration**: rate of change of velocity

### Key Equations

**Velocity**: v = Δs/Δt

**Acceleration**: a = Δv/Δt

Where Δ means "change in"

### Instantaneous vs Average Speed

**Instantaneous speed/velocity**: speed at any given point in time
- On a displacement-time graph: gradient of tangent at that point

**Average speed/velocity**: total distance (or displacement) ÷ total time
- On a displacement-time graph: total displacement ÷ total time

| **Y-intercept** | Initial displacement |
| **Straight line** | Constant velocity |
| **Positive slope** | Motion in positive direction |

| Feature | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Gradient** | Acceleration |
| **Y-intercept** | Initial velocity |
| **Straight line** | Uniform acceleration |
| **Positive slope** | Acceleration in positive direction |
| **Negative slope** | Acceleration in negative direction |
| **Curved line** | Non-uniform acceleration |
| **Horizontal line** | Constant velocity |
| **Area under curve** | Displacement |

| **Horizontal line** | Constant acceleration |
| **Area under curve** | Change in velocity |

### Motion of a Bouncing Ball

For a ball bouncing vertically (taking upwards as positive):

**At maximum height (Point A):**
- Maximum displacement
- Zero velocity (momentarily)
- Velocity changes from positive to negative
- Acceleration = -g (still constant, downward)

**At ground level (Point B):**
- Minimum displacement
- Velocity changes instantaneously from negative to positive
- Speed magnitude remains the same
- Momentary acceleration due to change in direction

## 3. SUVAT Equations

### The Variables

- **s** = displacement (m)
- **u** = initial velocity (m s⁻¹)
- **v** = final velocity (m s⁻¹)
- **a** = acceleration (m s⁻²)
- **t** = time (s)

### The Four Equations

1. **v = u + at**

2. **s = ut + ½at²**

3. **s = (v + u)t/2**

4. **v² = u² + 2as**

### Key Points

- All variables except time are **vectors** (can be positive or negative)
- "Starts from rest" means **u = 0**
- For free fall under gravity: **a = g = 9.81 m s⁻²**
- Choose consistent positive/negative directions

### How to Use SUVAT Equations

**Step 1**: List known and unknown variables (including implicit ones like u = 0)

**Step 2**: Choose the equation containing your known variables and the unknown you're finding

**Step 3**: Convert units to SI (m, s, m s⁻¹, m s⁻²) and solve

## 4. Projectile Motion

### What is a Projectile?

A projectile is a particle moving freely under gravity in a two-dimensional plane (non-powered motion).

### Key Concepts

**Resultant velocity components:**
- **Horizontal component**: u cosθ
- **Vertical component**: u sinθ

Where u is the initial velocity and θ is the angle to the horizontal.

### Important Terms

**Time of flight**: Total time projectile is in air
- Time to maximum height = ½ × total time

**Maximum height**: Height where vertical velocity = 0
- Occurs at half the total time

**Range**: Horizontal distance travelled

### Horizontal vs Vertical Components

| Component | Displacement | Velocity | Acceleration |
|-----------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **Horizontal** | Maximum range at end; half range at max height | **Constant** | **Zero** |
| **Vertical** | Maximum height at top of motion | **Zero at max height** | **g = 9.81 m s⁻²** (always downward) |

### Useful Formulae

**Time of flight**: T = 2u sinθ/g

**Maximum height**: H = (u sinθ)²/(2g)

**Range**: R = u² sin2θ/g

### Effects of Air Resistance

Air resistance:
- Decreases horizontal velocity component
- Reduces both range and maximum height
- Creates steeper descent gradient
- Makes trajectory asymmetric

## 5. Drag Forces

### Definition

Drag forces oppose motion of objects through fluids (liquids and gases).

Examples: friction, air resistance

### Characteristics

- Always in **opposite direction** to motion
- **Never** speed objects up or start motion
- Slow objects down or maintain constant speed
- Convert kinetic energy to heat and sound
- **Increase with speed** of the object

### Lift

Lift is an upward force perpendicular to fluid flow (e.g., on aeroplane wings).

### Factors Affecting Drag

1. **Surface area**: larger area → greater drag
2. **Mass**: greater mass → greater weight to overcome drag
3. **Fluid density**: denser fluid → greater drag

---

## 6. Terminal Velocity

### Definition

**Terminal velocity** is the maximum constant velocity reached when drag force equals weight.

### How Terminal Velocity is Reached

1. Object starts falling with only weight acting
2. Velocity increases → drag force increases
3. Resultant force decreases → acceleration decreases
4. When drag force = weight: resultant force = 0
5. Acceleration = 0 → **constant velocity** (terminal velocity)

### Velocity-Time Graph

The graph shows:
- Initial steep gradient (high acceleration)
- Decreasing gradient (decreasing acceleration)
- Horizontal line (zero acceleration at terminal velocity)

### Example: Skydivers

- Heavier skydiver → higher terminal velocity
- When parachute opens → increased drag → deceleration to lower terminal velocity
- Skydiver does **not** move upwards when parachute opens (common misconception)

## 7. Required Practical: Determination of g

### Aim

Calculate the value of acceleration due to gravity (g) by measuring time for a ball-bearing to fall a known distance.

### Variables

- **Independent**: height (h)
- **Dependent**: time (t)
- **Control**: same ball-bearing, same electromagnet, same distance from electromagnet

### Method Summary

1. Set up electromagnet at top of clamp stand with glass tube below
2. Position two light gates at measured distance h apart
3. Release ball-bearing from electromagnet
4. Timer starts at first light gate, stops at second
5. Record time t
6. Repeat for different heights (at least 5-10 values)
7. Repeat each height 3-5 times and calculate average t

### Analysis

Use SUVAT equation: **s = ut + ½at²**

For dropped object (u = 0): **h = ½gt²**

Rearranging: **2h/t = gt + 0**

This gives straight line equation: **y = mx + c**

Where:
- y = 2h/t
- x = t
- **Gradient = g**
- y-intercept = 2u (should be ~0)

**Plot 2h/t against t** → gradient = g

### Calculating Uncertainty

1. Error in h = ½ resolution of metre ruler (typically 0.5 mm)
2. Error in t = ½ range of repeated measurements
3. Add percentage uncertainties to find error in 2h/t
4. Draw error bars and line of worst fit
5. Fractional uncertainty in g = (difference in gradients)/(gradient of best fit)

### Sources of Error

**Systematic errors:**
- Residual magnetism causes longer time readings

**Random errors:**
- Large uncertainty from metre ruler precision
- Parallax error reading height
- Ball not falling centrally through light gates

**Reducing errors:**
- Repeat measurements 3-5 times and average
- Use tall clamp stand for larger distances
- Ensure vertical alignment

### Safety

- Switch on electromagnet only when fully set up (electrical safety)
- Use cushion to catch ball (prevent damage/rolling)
- Secure clamp stand with G-clamp (prevent tipping)
