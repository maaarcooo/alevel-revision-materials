# 3.7 Bulk Properties of Solids - Revision Notes

## 1. Density

**Definition:** Mass per unit volume of an object

**Formula:**
$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$

Where:
- ρ = density (kg m⁻³ or g cm⁻³)
- m = mass (kg or g)
- V = volume (m³ or cm³)

**Key Points:**
- Objects made from low-density materials have lower mass for a given volume
- Gases are less dense than solids
- Volume calculations depend on object shape:
  - Sphere: V = (4/3)πr³
  - Cube: V = d³
  - Cylinder: V = πr²L

**Unit Conversions:**
- 1 mm³ = 1 × 10⁻⁹ m³
- 1 cm³ = 1 × 10⁻⁶ m³
- Larger to smaller units: multiply
- Smaller to larger units: divide
- For cubic conversions, cube the conversion factor

## 2. Hooke's Law

**Definition:** The extension of a material is directly proportional to the applied force (load) up to the limit of proportionality

**Formula:**
$$F = k\Delta L$$

Where:
- F = force (N)
- k = spring constant (N m⁻¹)
- ΔL = extension (m)

**Key Points:**
- Spring constant measures the **stiffness** of a material
- Larger spring constant = stiffer material
- Applies to both **extensions** and **compressions**
- Extension = stretched length − unstretched length

### Force-Extension Graphs

**Linear region (Hooke's Law obeyed):**
- Straight line through origin
- Gradient = spring constant (k)

**Important points:**
- **Limit of proportionality:** Beyond this, Hooke's law no longer applies
- **Elastic limit:** Beyond this, material won't return to original length

**Note:** If extension is on y-axis and force on x-axis, gradient = 1/k

## 3. Stress & Strain

### Tensile Stress

**Definition:** Force exerted per unit cross-sectional area

$$\text{Tensile stress, } \sigma = \frac{F}{A}$$

Where:
- σ = tensile stress (Pa)
- F = force applied (N)
- A = cross-sectional area (m²)

**Ultimate tensile stress (UTS):** Maximum stress a material can withstand before breaking

### Tensile Strain

**Definition:** Extension per unit length

$$\text{Tensile strain} = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$$

Where:
- ΔL = extension (m)
- L = original length (m)

**Key Points:**
- Strain is **dimensionless** (ratio of lengths)
- Sometimes expressed as percentage: (ΔL/L) × 100%

### Stress-Strain Curves

**Important features:**
- **Limit of proportionality:** Extension no longer proportional to stress
- **Elastic limit:** Material won't return to original length beyond this
- **Yield stress:** Material extends plastically with little/no stress increase
- **Breaking point:** Maximum stress before fracture
- **Elastic region:** Material returns to original shape when force removed
- **Plastic region:** Permanent deformation occurs

**Area under Hooke's Law region = elastic strain energy per unit volume**

## 4. Elastic Strain Energy

**Definition:** Work done to stretch a material (when obeying Hooke's Law)

**Formula:**
$$E = \frac{1}{2}F\Delta L$$

Or using Hooke's Law (F = kΔL):
$$E = \frac{1}{2}k(\Delta L)^2$$

Where:
- E = elastic strain energy (J)
- F = average force (N)
- k = spring constant (N m⁻¹)
- ΔL = extension (m)

**Key Points:**
- Equals **area under force-extension graph** (for Hooke's Law region)
- For non-Hooke's Law region: calculate total area under curve
- Before elastic limit, all work done is stored as elastic strain energy

### Spring Energy in Vertical Systems

A mass on a vertical spring converts between:
- **Elastic potential energy (EPE):** Maximum at maximum extension/compression
- **Kinetic energy (KE):** Maximum at equilibrium position
- **Gravitational potential energy (GPE):** Maximum at highest point

For horizontal springs, only EPE and KE are considered (no GPE change).

## 5. Elastic & Plastic Behaviour

### Elastic Deformation
- Material returns to original shape when load removed
- Occurs in **elastic region** (below elastic limit)
- Extension proportional to force

### Plastic Deformation
- Material permanently deformed
- Does not return to original shape when load removed
- Occurs in **plastic region** (beyond elastic limit)
- Extension no longer proportional to force

### Material Classifications

**Brittle materials:**
- Very little or no plastic region
- Break with minimal elastic/plastic deformation
- Examples: glass, concrete, ceramic
- Stress-strain graph: straight line with abrupt break

**Ductile materials:**
- Large plastic region
- Stretch significantly before breaking
- Examples: copper, rubber
- Stress-strain graph: straight line followed by curve

**Breaking stress:** Maximum stress a material can withstand before fracturing

## 6. Energy Conservation in Deformation

### Loading and Unloading a Metal Wire

When a wire is stretched beyond its limit of proportionality:
- **Loading:** Force applied, wire extends (including plastic deformation)
- **Unloading:** Force removed, extension decreases
- Unloading line is **parallel** to loading line (k unchanged)
- Unloading line does **not** pass through origin (permanent extension remains)

**Area between loading and unloading lines = work done to permanently deform the wire**

### Loading and Unloading a Rubber Band

Rubber band shows different curves for stretching and contracting:
- Stretching curve is above contracting curve
- No permanent extension (returns to original length)
- Material is **elastic**

**Energy differences:**
- **Area X:** Work done heating the rubber (thermal energy)
- **Area Y:** Work done by rubber returning to original shape
- **Area X + Y:** Total work done stretching rubber
- Difference in strain energy → converted to thermal energy (rubber becomes warm)

### Vehicle Suspension Systems

**Components:** Tires, springs, shock absorbers

**Function:**
- Absorb impact forces from bumpy roads
- Keep tires in contact with road surface
- Improve vehicle handling and passenger comfort

**Shock absorbers:**
- Dampen compression and rebound of springs
- Convert **kinetic energy** → **thermal energy** (dissipated)
- Provide more resistance at higher speeds
- Prevent excessive vibrations and maintain vehicle control

## Exam Tips

1. **Always check graph axes** before determining spring constant
2. **Unit conversions:** Remember to cube conversion factors for volume
3. **Breaking stress vs UTS:** Both refer to maximum stress before failure
4. **Plastic deformation:** Describe as "permanently deformed" not just "doesn't obey Hooke's law"
5. **Graph questions:** Mark schemes allow acceptable ranges for subjective readings
6. **Area calculations:** For non-linear regions, split into triangles and trapeziums
7. **Extension vs Length:** Extension is the change in length, not total length
