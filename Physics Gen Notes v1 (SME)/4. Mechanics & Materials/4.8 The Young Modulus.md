# 3.8 The Young Modulus - Revision Notes

## Definition and Concept

**The Young Modulus** is a measure of the ability of a material to withstand changes in length with an added load. It provides information about the **stiffness** of a material.

- Critical for engineers to ensure materials can withstand sufficient forces
- Defined as the **ratio of tensile stress to tensile strain**

### Formula

$$\text{Young Modulus} = \frac{\text{Tensile stress}}{\text{Tensile strain}} = \frac{FL}{A\Delta L}$$

**Where:**
- F = force (N)
- L = original length (m)
- A = cross-sectional area (m²)
- ΔL = extension (m)

**Units:** Pascals (Pa), typically in the order of GPa (10⁹ Pa)

**Note:** Since strain is dimensionless, the Young Modulus has the same units as stress.

**Memory aid:** "When you're stressed, you show the strain" → Stress ÷ Strain

## Typical Young Modulus Values

| Material | Young's Modulus (GPa) |
|----------|----------------------|
| Aluminium | 70 |
| Steel | 110 |
| Copper | 117 |
| Brass | 120 |
| Iron | 170 |
| Nickel | 240 |

## Young Modulus from Stress-Strain Graphs

The Young Modulus equals the **gradient** of a stress-strain graph in the **linear region** (where the graph is a straight line).

- This linear region is where **Hooke's Law is obeyed**
- The area under the graph in this region equals the **energy stored per unit volume** of the material

$$\text{Young Modulus} = \frac{\Delta \text{Stress}}{\Delta \text{Strain}} = \text{gradient}$$

## Calculation Example

**Problem:** A metal wire with cross-sectional area 0.04 mm² has a 92 N load applied. The length increases by 0.50%. Calculate the Young Modulus.

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Calculate stress
- Convert area: 0.04 mm² = 4 × 10⁻⁸ m²
- Stress = F/A = 92/(4 × 10⁻⁸) = 2.3 × 10⁹ Pa

**Step 2:** Calculate strain
- Strain = ΔL/L = 0.5% = 0.005

**Step 3:** Calculate Young Modulus
- E = Stress/Strain = (2.3 × 10⁹)/0.005 = **4.6 × 10¹¹ Pa**

## Required Practical: Measuring Young Modulus

### Aim
To measure the Young Modulus of a metal wire.

### Variables

**Independent variable:** Force/load (N)

**Dependent variable:** Extension (m)

**Control variables:**
- Original length of wire
- Thickness of wire
- Type of metal

### Equipment

| Equipment | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Bench | Hold the equipment |
| G-clamp | Stabilise the apparatus |
| Copper wire | Sample to test |
| Metre ruler | Measure length and extension |
| Pulley | Allow mass to hang vertically, reduce friction |
| Tape marker | Accurately measure extension |
| Wooden blocks | Clamp wire to keep it taut and straight |
| Mass hanger + 100g masses | Create extension |
| Micrometer | Measure wire diameter |

**Measurement resolution:**
- Metre ruler: 1 mm
- Micrometer: 0.001 mm

---

### Method

1. Measure wire diameter using micrometer at **at least 3 different positions** and calculate average

2. Set up apparatus with wire taut (no masses on hanger yet)

3. Measure original length of wire using metre ruler

4. Mark a reference point with tape (preferably at 1 cm on ruler)

5. Record initial ruler reading at the tape marker

6. Add 100g mass to hanger

7. Record new ruler reading at tape marker

8. Calculate extension: ΔL = new reading - initial reading

9. Repeat steps 6-8 by adding 100g masses incrementally (**5-10 readings total**)

10. Record all data in a table

**Example data table:**

| Mass (g) | Load F (N) | Initial length (mm) | Final length (mm) | Extension ΔL (× 10⁻³ m) |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| 200 | 2.0 | 500 | 500.1 | 0.1 |
| 300 | 2.9 | 500.1 | 500.4 | 0.3 |
| 400 | 3.9 | 500.4 | 501.0 | 0.6 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Analysis of Results

**Step 1: Calculate cross-sectional area**

$$A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}$$

where d = average diameter in metres

**Step 2: Plot graph**

Plot **load (force) against extension**
- x-axis: Extension ΔL (m)
- y-axis: Load F (N)
- Convert mass to force: F = mg (use g = 9.81 N kg⁻¹)
- Draw best-fit straight line through origin

**Step 3: Calculate gradient**

$$\text{Gradient} = \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta L}$$

**Step 4: Calculate Young Modulus**

Rearranging the Young Modulus equation:

$$F = \left(\frac{\text{Young Modulus} \times A}{L}\right) \Delta L$$

Comparing to y = mx:
- y = F
- x = ΔL
- Gradient m = (Young Modulus × A)/L

Therefore:

$$\text{Young Modulus} = \text{Gradient} \times \frac{L}{A}$$

---

### Example Calculation

**Given data:**
- Original length L = 1.382 m
- Average diameter d = 0.277 mm = 2.77 × 10⁻⁴ m
- Cross-sectional area A = 6.03 × 10⁻⁸ m²
- Gradient from graph = 2812.5 N m⁻¹

**Calculation:**

$$\text{Young Modulus} = 2812.5 \times \frac{1.382}{6.03 \times 10^{-8}} = 6.4 \times 10^{10} \text{ Pa}$$

## Evaluating the Experiment

### Systematic Errors

**Issue:** Inaccurate extension measurements
- **Solution:** Use a vernier scale for more precise readings

**Issue:** Wire extended past elastic limit (permanently deformed)
- **Solution:** Remove load after each reading and check wire returns to original length before taking new readings

### Random Errors

**Issue:** Parallax error when reading marker on ruler
- **Solution:** Ensure eye is level with marker; use a set square

**Issue:** Inconsistent diameter measurements
- **Solution:** Take diameter measurements at multiple positions along wire and calculate average

**Issue:** Extension readings vary
- **Solution:** Repeat experiment for all loads and find average extension values

### Improvements

- Use a **longer wire** (increases extension, reducing percentage uncertainty)
- Take **multiple readings** at each load
- Use **digital callipers** for more accurate diameter measurement
- Ensure wire is **perfectly vertical** to avoid friction effects
- Use a **reference wire** to account for temperature changes

---

## Safety Considerations

- **Wear safety goggles** at all times (wire may snap)
- Keep a **cushion or soft surface** directly below mass hanger in case it falls
- Do not overload the wire beyond its elastic limit
- Secure all clamps firmly to prevent apparatus falling

## Key Points Summary

1. Young Modulus = Stress/Strain = FL/(AΔL)
2. Units are Pascals (Pa), typically GPa for most materials
3. Equals the gradient of the linear region of a stress-strain graph
4. Only valid in the region where Hooke's Law is obeyed
5. In the practical, plot F vs ΔL and calculate: E = gradient × L/A
6. Take multiple diameter measurements and use the average
7. Check wire returns to original length after each measurement
8. A longer wire gives more measurable extension, reducing uncertainty
