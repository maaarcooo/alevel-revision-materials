# 3.2 Moments - Revision Notes

## 1. Moments

### Definition
A **moment** is the turning effect of a force about a pivot point.

### Formula
```
Moment (N m) = Force (N) × Perpendicular distance from pivot (m)
```

**Units**: Newton metres (N m) or Newton centimetres (N cm)

### Key Points
- The distance must be **perpendicular** to the line of action of the force
- If the force is not perpendicular, use the component: **Moment = F × d cos(θ)**
- Moments cause objects to rotate about a pivot
- Practical example: door handles are placed far from hinges to maximise the moment and make opening easier

## 2. The Principle of Moments

### Statement
**For a system in equilibrium:**
```
Sum of clockwise moments = Sum of anticlockwise moments
(about the same point)
```

### Equation
```
F₂ × d₂ = (F₁ × d₁) + (F₃ × d₃)
```

### Key Points
- All moments must be taken about the **same pivot point**
- All distances must be in the **same units**
- Not all forces provide a turning effect - only consider those perpendicular to distances from the pivot
- Objects in equilibrium have no net rotation

## 3. Couples

### Definition
A **couple** is a pair of equal and opposite coplanar forces that produces rotation only.

### Properties of a Couple
- Forces are **equal in magnitude**
- Forces are **opposite in direction**
- Forces are **perpendicular** to the distance between them
- Forces do **not** share the same line of action

### Moment of a Couple
```
Moment of couple = Force × Perpendicular distance between forces
```

### Key Points
- Couples produce **zero resultant force** (F = 0)
- Therefore, by Newton's Second Law (F = ma), the object does **not accelerate**
- The moment of a couple does **not depend on a pivot** point
- Couples produce pure rotation

## 4. Centre of Mass

### Definition
The **centre of mass** is the point at which the weight of an object may be considered to act.

### Position
- For **uniform regular solids**: at the geometric centre
- For **symmetrical objects** with uniform density: at the point of symmetry
- Examples:
  - Sphere: at the centre
  - Person standing upright: roughly behind the navel

### Stability

**An object is stable when its centre of mass lies above its base.**

**Factors affecting stability:**

1. **Base width**
   - Wider base → Lower centre of mass → **More stable**
   - Narrower base → Higher centre of mass → **Less stable** (easier to topple)

2. **Centre of mass position**
   - Most stable objects have **wide bases** and **low centres of mass**

**Toppling occurs when:** The centre of mass moves beyond the edge of the base (no longer above the base).

### Centre of Gravity vs Centre of Mass

| Aspect | Centre of Mass | Centre of Gravity |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Definition** | Point where mass is concentrated | Point where weight acts |
| **Depends on gravity?** | No | Yes (weight = mg) |
| **In uniform field** | Identical to centre of gravity | Identical to centre of mass |
| **In non-uniform field** | Fixed geometric point | Shifts towards stronger field |

**Key Point**: The centre of mass is a hypothetical point that can lie **inside or outside** a body, depending on the shape.

## Summary Checklist

✓ Moment = Force × Perpendicular distance  
✓ Principle: Clockwise moments = Anticlockwise moments (equilibrium)  
✓ Couple = Pair of equal, opposite forces producing rotation only  
✓ Moment of couple = Force × Distance between forces  
✓ Centre of mass = Point where weight acts  
✓ Stability increases with wider base and lower centre of mass  
✓ Object topples when centre of mass moves beyond base  
✓ Centre of gravity = Centre of mass (in uniform gravitational field)
