# Newton's Laws of Motion - Revision Notes

## Newton's First Law

### Statement
**An object will remain at rest or move with constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force**

### Key Implications
- An object at rest will remain at rest unless acted upon by a resultant force
- An object moving with constant velocity will continue moving at that constant velocity unless acted upon by a resultant force
- A **resultant force is required** to change the motion of an object:
  - To speed up
  - To slow down
  - To change direction

### Balanced Forces
If the forces on a body are **balanced** (resultant force = 0), the body must be:
- At rest, OR
- Moving at a constant velocity

Since force is a vector, it's easier to split forces into **horizontal** and **vertical** components.

If forces are balanced:
- Forces acting left = Forces acting right
- Forces acting upward = Forces acting downward

### Important Note
The resultant force is the **vector sum** of all forces acting on the body.

## Newton's Second Law

### Statement
**The resultant force acting on an object with constant mass is directly proportional to its acceleration**

### Equation
$$F = ma$$

Where:
- **F** = resultant force (N)
- **m** = mass (kg)
- **a** = acceleration (m s⁻²)

### Key Principles
- The acceleration **always acts in the same direction** as the resultant force
- When **unbalanced forces** act on an object, it experiences a resultant force

### Effects of Resultant Force
**If resultant force acts along the direction of motion:**
- Speed up (accelerate)
- Slow down (decelerate)

**If resultant force acts at an angle to direction of motion:**
- Change direction

### Resultant Force
- Force is a **vector quantity** with magnitude and direction
- Resultant force = **vector sum** of all forces acting on the body
- If object is in motion, positive direction = direction of motion
- Resultant forces can be positive or negative depending on direction

### Acceleration
- Acceleration is a **vector quantity** with magnitude and direction
- If resultant force acts in direction of motion → **positive acceleration**
- If resultant force opposes direction of motion → **negative acceleration**
- Acceleration **always acts in the same direction** as the resultant force

**Important:** A resultant force opposing motion causes the object to **decelerate**, not suddenly travel backwards.

### Direction Convention
- Direction of object's motion = **positive direction**
- Forward, upwards, right = **positive**
- Backward, downwards, left = **negative**

### Newton's Second Law and Momentum

Alternative form:
$$F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$

**The resultant force equals the rate of change of momentum**

This is derived from:
- Momentum: p = mv
- Rate of change: Δp/Δt = m(Δv/Δt)
- Since a = Δv/Δt, therefore F = ma

### Key Fact
If no drag forces present, the **acceleration of a falling object is independent of its mass**. This was demonstrated on the Moon where a hammer and feather dropped simultaneously hit the ground at the same time (no air resistance).

## Newton's Third Law

### Statement
**If Object A exerts a force on Object B, then Object B will exert a force on Object A which is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction**

### Third Law Force Pairs
When two objects interact, forces arise in pairs (third-law pairs).

### Criteria for Third Law Pairs
A Newton's third law force pair **must** be:
1. The **same type** of force
2. The **same magnitude**
3. **Opposite** in direction
4. Acting on **different objects**

### Example: Walking
- The **foot** pushes the **ground** backwards
- The **ground** pushes the **foot** forwards
- Both forces are normal contact forces
- Equal magnitude, opposite direction
- Acting on different objects (foot and ground)

### Important Distinction
**Newton's First Law vs Third Law:**

**First Law:**
- Deals with **multiple forces** acting on a **single object**
- Free-body force diagrams show forces on ONE object
- Example: Weight and reaction force both acting on a book

**Third Law:**
- Deals with forces when **two objects interact**
- Forces act on **different objects**
- Example: Book pushes table, table pushes book

### Common Third Law Pairs

**Book on Table:**
1. **Contact forces:** Table pushes book upward ↔ Book pushes table downward
2. **Gravitational forces:** Earth pulls book downward ↔ Book pulls Earth upward

### Critical Warning
Just because two forces are equal magnitude and opposite direction does **NOT** mean they are third law pairs. They must meet **ALL four criteria**.

## Worked Example Strategies

### For Newton's Second Law Problems:
1. Draw a force diagram with forces in correct directions
2. Convert all forces to newtons (N)
3. Assign positive direction (usually direction of motion)
4. Calculate resultant force: F = sum of all forces (considering signs)
5. Use F = ma to find acceleration or mass
6. State direction of acceleration (same as resultant force)

### For Newton's Third Law Problems:
1. State both Newton's First and Third Laws
2. Check if forces meet all four criteria:
   - Same type?
   - Same magnitude?
   - Opposite direction?
   - Acting on different objects?
3. Identify the two interacting objects
4. Use framework: "Object A pushes/pulls Object B, and Object B pushes/pulls Object A"

## Key Equations Summary

| Equation | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| F = ma | Newton's Second Law |
| F = Δp/Δt | Newton's Second Law (momentum form) |
| p = mv | Momentum |
| Δp = mv_f - mv_i | Change in momentum |

## Common Misconceptions

1. ❌ Objects naturally slow down to a stop
   ✅ Objects maintain constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force

2. ❌ Opposing force makes object suddenly go backwards
   ✅ Opposing force causes object to decelerate

3. ❌ Equal and opposite forces always mean third law pairs
   ✅ Must meet all four criteria (type, magnitude, direction, different objects)

4. ❌ Free-body diagrams show third law pairs
   ✅ Free-body diagrams show multiple forces on ONE object (Newton's First Law)

5. ❌ Heavier objects fall faster
   ✅ In absence of air resistance, all objects fall with same acceleration
