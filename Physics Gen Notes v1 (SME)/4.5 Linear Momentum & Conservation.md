# 3.5 Linear Momentum & Conservation - Revision Notes

## 1. Linear Momentum

### Definition
**Momentum** is defined as the product of mass and velocity:

$$p = mv$$

**Where:**
- p = momentum (kg m s⁻¹)
- m = mass (kg)
- v = velocity (m s⁻¹)

### Key Properties
- **Vector quantity** with both magnitude and direction
- Initial direction of motion is usually assigned as positive
- Remains **constant** unless acted upon by an external resultant force
- If an object is stationary (v = 0), then p = 0

### Sign Convention
- Positive momentum: motion in initial/chosen positive direction
- Negative momentum: motion in opposite direction
- When an object rebounds, velocity (and momentum) change sign

## 2. Conservation of Momentum

### The Principle
**The total momentum before a collision equals the total momentum after a collision, provided no external force acts.**

$$\text{Total momentum before} = \text{Total momentum after}$$

$$p_{Ai} + p_{Bi} = p_{Af} + p_{Bf}$$

**Where:**
- p_Ai = initial momentum of object A
- p_Bi = initial momentum of object B
- p_Af = final momentum of object A
- p_Bf = final momentum of object B

### External vs Internal Forces
- **External forces**: act on a system from outside (e.g. friction, weight)
- **Internal forces**: forces exchanged by particles within the system (e.g. tension in a string)
- **Closed/isolated systems**: no external forces act, total momentum is conserved

### Examples
- Swimmer diving from a boat: diver moves forward, boat moves backward
- Gun recoil: bullet moves forward, gun moves backward
- Both have zero initial momentum, so final momenta must cancel out

## 3. Force & Momentum

### Newton's Second Law (Alternative Form)
Force can be defined as the **rate of change of momentum**:

$$F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$

**Where:**
- F = resultant force (N)
- Δp = change in momentum (kg m s⁻¹)
- Δt = change in time (s)

### Change in Momentum
$$\Delta p = p_{\text{final}} - p_{\text{initial}} = mv - mu$$

### Direction of Forces
- Force is a **vector quantity**
- Force opposing initial velocity is negative
- Forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (Newton's Third Law)

## 4. Impulse

### Definition
**Impulse** is the product of force applied and the time for which it acts:

$$\text{Impulse} = F\Delta t$$

### Relationship to Momentum
Since F = Δp/Δt, we can write:

$$\text{Impulse} = F\Delta t = \Delta p = mv - mu$$

### Key Properties
- **Units**: newton seconds (N s) or kg m s⁻¹
- **Vector quantity** with magnitude and direction
- Impulse is in the direction of the resultant force
- A **small force over a long time** has the same effect as a **large force over a short time**

### Applications
Examples of impulse in everyday life:
- Kicking a ball
- Catching a ball
- Collision between two objects
- Hail vs rain on an umbrella (hail has greater impulse due to larger mass and rebound)

## 5. Impulse on a Force-Time Graph

### The Area Under the Graph
When force varies with time, **impulse equals the area under the force-time graph**.

$$\text{Impulse} = \text{Area under } F\text{-}t \text{ graph}$$

### Calculating Area
- **Curve**: count squares underneath
- **Straight lines**: split into sections (triangles, rectangles, trapeziums), sum the areas
- Total area = total impulse

### Relationship Between Force and Time
For the same change in momentum (impulse):
- **Longer contact time** → **smaller force**
- **Shorter contact time** → **larger force**

---

## 6. Impact Forces

### Reducing Impact Forces
**Impact forces are reduced by increasing the contact time.**

### Examples

**In Sports:**
- **Cricket fielder** moves hands backward when catching to increase Δt and reduce F
- **Football kick** follows through to increase Δt and increase momentum transfer

**In Packaging:**
- Bubble wrap and polyester packaging increase contact time
- Reduces force on fragile items during transit

## 7. Collisions

### Types of Collisions

| Type | Momentum | Kinetic Energy | Behaviour |
|------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Elastic** | Conserved | Conserved | Objects move in opposite directions |
| **Inelastic** | Conserved | **NOT** conserved | Objects stick together |

### Testing for Elastic/Inelastic
Calculate kinetic energy before and after:

$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

- If KE_before = KE_after → **elastic**
- If KE_before ≠ KE_after → **inelastic**

### Explosions
- Similar to collisions but objects move apart
- Examples: gun recoil, radioactive decay (alpha emission)
- Momentum is conserved

## 8. Vehicle Safety Features

### Purpose
Safety features increase contact time during collisions to reduce force on passengers.

$$F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} \quad \text{(larger } \Delta t \text{ means smaller } F\text{)}$$

### Key Safety Features

**1. Seat Belts**
- Prevent passenger from colliding with vehicle interior
- Stretch slightly to increase contact time
- Reduce force on passenger

**2. Airbags**
- Deploy from dashboard, steering wheel, and doors
- Act as soft cushion
- Increase contact time, reducing force

**3. Crumple Zones**
- Front and back of vehicle designed to crush/crumple
- Absorb energy upon impact
- Increase time for momentum to reach zero
- Reduce force on passengers

### Force-Time Graph Comparison
With safety features:
- Lower peak force
- Wider base (longer contact time)
- **Same area** under graph (same impulse/change in momentum)

## Exam Tips

1. **Unit conversion**: Convert grams to kg (÷1000), km s⁻¹ to m s⁻¹ (×1000)

2. **Sign convention**: Choose a positive direction and be consistent throughout

3. **Stationary objects**: If v = 0, then p = 0

4. **Stuck objects**: Treat final object as single mass (m₁ + m₂)

5. **Vector nature**: Pay attention to direction - rebounding objects change sign

6. **Rate of change**: "Rate of change" means dividing by Δt

7. **Force direction**: Look for keywords like "from", "acting on", "exerted on"

8. **Base units**: 1 N = 1 kg m s⁻² (useful for checking units)

9. **Elastic vs Inelastic**: Calculate KE before and after to determine collision type

10. **Force-time graphs**: Area = impulse (count squares or calculate shapes)
