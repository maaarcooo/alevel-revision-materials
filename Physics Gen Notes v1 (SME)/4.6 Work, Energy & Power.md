# 3.6 Work, Energy & Power - Revision Notes

## Work & Power

### Work Done
- **Work done** by a force is equivalent to a **transfer of energy**
- Unit: joules (J), where **1 N m = 1 J**
- Work done by a resultant force equals the change in energy in that system

**Definition:** The amount of energy transferred when an external force causes an object to move over a certain distance

### Work Done Equations

**Force parallel to displacement:**
```
W = Fs
```
Where:
- W = work done (J)
- F = force (N)
- s = displacement (m)

**Force at an angle to displacement:**
```
W = Fs cos θ
```
Where:
- θ = angle between force direction and motion direction
- When θ = 0°, cos θ = 1, so W = Fs
- For **horizontal motion**, use cos θ
- For **vertical motion**, use sin θ

**Key Point:** Only the component of force **parallel to displacement** does work

### Power

**Definition:** The rate of doing work or the rate of energy transfer

```
P = ΔW/Δt
```

Where:
- P = power (W)
- ΔW = work done (J)
- Δt = time (s)

**Alternative equation (for constant velocity and constant force):**
```
P = Fv
```

Where:
- F = force in direction of velocity (N)
- v = velocity (m s⁻¹)

**Power increases when:**
- Greater energy transfer (more work done)
- Energy transferred over shorter time

## Area Under Force-Displacement Graph

### Key Principle
**Work done = Area under force-displacement graph**

### Method
1. If force is constant: W = Fs (rectangle area)
2. If force varies: Split graph into sections (rectangles, triangles, trapeziums)
3. Calculate area of each section
4. Sum all areas for total work done

**Remember:** Check units on axes - convert kN to N, km to m if necessary

---

## Variable Forces

When force is **not constant**:
- **Cannot** use W = Fs or P = Fv directly
- **Must** find area under force-displacement graph
- If varying force increases → object's acceleration increases

---

## Efficiency

**Definition:** The ratio of useful power output from a system to its total power input

### Efficiency Equations

**Using power:**
```
Efficiency = (Useful power output / Total power input) × 100%
```

**Using energy:**
```
Efficiency = (Useful energy output / Total energy input) × 100%
```

### Key Points
- Expressed as percentage (0-100%) or ratio (0-1)
- **No units** (both numerator and denominator have same units)
- **High efficiency** = most energy transferred is useful
- **Low efficiency** = most energy transferred is wasted

**What counts as useful/wasted depends on the system:**
- Light bulb: light = useful, heat = wasted
- Heater: heat = useful, sound = wasted

---

## Conservation of Energy

### Principle of Conservation of Energy
**Energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be transferred from one form to another**

- Total energy in a **closed system** remains constant
- Forms may change, but total amount stays the same

### Types of Energy

| Form | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Kinetic** | Energy of a moving object |
| **Gravitational Potential** | Energy gained when lifted up, lost when it falls |
| **Elastic** | Energy of a stretched spring or elastic band (strain energy) |
| **Chemical** | Energy contained in a chemical substance |
| **Nuclear** | Energy contained within the nucleus of an atom |
| **Internal** | Energy due to temperature or state (thermal/heat energy) |

### Energy Dissipation
- No energy transfer is 100% efficient
- Some energy is **dissipated** to surroundings
- **Dissipated energy** = wasted energy (cannot easily be used)
- Commonly dissipated as: **thermal (heat), light, or sound**

### Common Energy Transfers

**Examples:**
- Falling object (vacuum): GPE → KE
- Battery: Chemical → Electrical
- Spring: Elastic PE → KE
- Trampoline: Elastic PE → KE → GPE

**With friction:**
- Loss in KE = Gain in GPE + Work done against friction

## Kinetic Energy

**Definition:** Energy an object has due to its motion (velocity)

### Equation
```
Ek = ½mv²
```

Where:
- Ek = kinetic energy (J)
- m = mass (kg)
- v = velocity (m s⁻¹)

### Key Points
- Faster object → greater kinetic energy
- Only **speed is squared**, not mass or ½
- Falling object **gains** KE (from GPE)
- Object slowing down **loses** KE

**Important:** Energy is scalar - don't use negative signs for "loss of kinetic energy"

---

## Gravitational Potential Energy

**Definition:** Energy stored in a mass due to its position in a gravitational field

### Equation (for uniform gravitational field)
```
ΔEp = mgΔh
```

Where:
- ΔEp = change in gravitational potential energy (J)
- m = mass (kg)
- g = gravitational field strength (9.81 N kg⁻¹)
- Δh = change in height (m)

### Key Points
- Mass lifted up → **gains** GPE
- Mass falls → **loses** GPE
- Ground level usually taken as zero GPE
- **Linear relationship** with height (straight-line graph)

### GPE vs Height Graphs
- **Object thrown upward:** GPE increases linearly with height
- **Object falling:** GPE decreases linearly with height
- Same pattern for GPE vs time

**Important:** This equation only applies to **uniform gravitational fields** (near Earth's surface)

| Work done (at angle) | W = Fs cos θ | θ = angle to displacement |
| Power (general) | P = ΔW/Δt | ΔW = work done, Δt = time |
| Power (moving object) | P = Fv | F = force, v = velocity |
| Efficiency | (Output/Input) × 100% | In power or energy |
| Kinetic energy | Ek = ½mv² | m = mass, v = velocity |
| GPE | ΔEp = mgΔh | m = mass, g = 9.81, Δh = height change |

## Common Exam Tips

1. **Force components:** Always identify the force component parallel to displacement
2. **Units:** Check graph axes - convert kN, km to SI units
3. **Efficiency:** No units; can be ratio or percentage
4. **Variable forces:** Must use area under graph method
5. **Energy transfers:** Identify what energy is useful vs wasted for each system
6. **Equations:** Know when each equation applies (constant vs varying forces)
7. **Graph sketching:** Label key points on axes even if not to scale
8. **Conservation:** Account for all energy transfers, including dissipated energy

## Worked Example Strategy

**For work done problems:**

2. Calculate relevant force component if needed
3. Apply W = Fs or W = Fs cos θ

**For force-displacement graphs:**
1. Split graph into recognisable shapes
2. Calculate area of each section
3. Sum all areas for total work

**For efficiency problems:**
1. Write efficiency equation
2. Identify useful vs total energy/power
3. Rearrange if needed
4. Calculate (watch for percentage vs ratio)

**For energy conservation:**
1. Identify initial energy type(s)
2. Identify final energy type(s)
3. Account for dissipated energy
4. Apply conservation: Total initial = Total final
