# Current-Voltage Characteristics
## AQA A Level Physics Revision Notes

## 1. Electric Current

### Definition
**Electric current** is the rate of flow of electric charge.

### Key Equation
$$I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$$

Where:
- I = current (A)
- ΔQ = charge flowing (C)
- Δt = time interval (s)

### Units
- Current: **amperes (A)**
- 1 A = 1 C s⁻¹

### Conventional Current vs Electron Flow
- **Conventional current**: flow of positive charge from positive to negative terminal
- **Electron flow**: actual movement of negatively charged electrons from negative to positive terminal
- These directions are **opposite** to each other

### Measurement
Current is measured using an **ammeter** connected **in series** with the component.

## 2. Potential Difference

### Definition
**Potential difference** is the electrical work done per unit charge flowing between two points.

### Key Equation
$$V = \frac{W}{Q}$$

Where:
- V = potential difference (V)
- W = electrical work done (J)
- Q = charge flow (C)

### Units
- Potential difference: **volts (V)**
- 1 V = 1 J C⁻¹

### Energy Transfer
- **Through a cell**: electrons gain energy (e.g., 12 V cell gives 12 J per coulomb)
- **Through a circuit**: electrons lose energy to components (e.g., 12 J per coulomb transferred to heat/light)

### Measurement
Potential difference is measured using a **voltmeter** connected **in parallel** with the component.

---

## 3. Resistance

### Definition
**Resistance** is the opposition of a component to the flow of electric current through it.

### Key Equation
$$R = \frac{V}{I}$$

Where:
- R = resistance (Ω)
- V = potential difference (V)
- I = current (A)

### Units
- Resistance: **ohms (Ω)**
- 1 Ω = potential difference of 1 V producing current of 1 A

### Properties
- **Higher resistance** → lower current (for given voltage)
- **Lower resistance** → higher current (for given voltage)
- Wires have low resistance (often assumed zero in calculations)
- Copper is used for wires due to its low electrical resistance

---

## 4. Ohm's Law

### Statement
For a conductor at **constant temperature**, the current through it is **directly proportional** to the potential difference across it.

### Equation
$$V = IR$$

### Conditions
- Constant temperature implies constant resistance
- A component obeys Ohm's law if its I-V graph is a **straight line through the origin**

---

## 5. I-V Characteristics

### Circuit for Investigation
A variable resistor is used to change voltage and current, with:
- Ammeter in series to measure current
- Voltmeter in parallel to measure voltage across the component

### Reading Graphs
**Gradient of I-V graph** = I/V = **1/R**

Therefore:
- Steep gradient = low resistance
- Shallow gradient = high resistance
- Increasing gradient = decreasing resistance
- Decreasing gradient = increasing resistance

## 6. Component Characteristics

### A. Ohmic Conductor (Resistor)

**Graph**: Straight line through the origin

**Properties**:
- Current is **directly proportional** to voltage
- **Constant resistance**
- **Obeys Ohm's law**
- Applies to metal wires at constant temperature

---

### B. Semiconductor Diode

**Graph**: Horizontal line (reverse bias) then sharp upward curve (forward bias)

**Properties**:
- **Forward bias**: current flows (in direction of arrow symbol)
  - Sharp increase in current at threshold voltage
- **Reverse bias**: no current flows
  - Approximately zero current and voltage
- **Does not obey Ohm's law**
- Allows current in **one direction only**

---

### C. Filament Lamp

**Graph**: S-shaped curve (symmetrical about origin)

**Properties**:
- Current increases at a **slower rate** than voltage
- **Resistance increases** as current increases
- **Does not obey Ohm's law** (except at very low voltages)

**Physical Explanation**:
1. As current increases → temperature of filament increases
2. Higher temperature → more resistance (in metals)
3. Higher resistance → current increases more slowly
4. Straight portions of graph = constant resistance
5. Curved portions = changing resistance

---

## 7. Summary Table

| Component | Graph Shape | Resistance | Obeys Ohm's Law? |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------------|
| **Resistor** | Straight line through origin | Constant | ✓ Yes |
| **Diode** | Flat then steep curve (one side only) | Infinite → low (forward bias only) | ✗ No |
| **Filament Lamp** | S-shaped curve | Increases with current | ✗ No (except at low V) |

---

## 8. Key Reminders

1. **Potential difference ≠ energy**: V is energy per unit charge (W = QV)
2. Two batteries with same voltage can store different amounts of energy
3. Wire resistance is assumed **zero** in exam questions
4. Gradient of I-V graph = 1/R (not R)
5. For components that don't obey Ohm's law, resistance varies with voltage/current
6. Always specify "at constant temperature" when stating Ohm's law

## 9. Essential Formulae

| Quantity | Symbol | Equation | Units |
|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| Current | I | I = ΔQ/Δt | A (amperes) |
| Potential Difference | V | V = W/Q | V (volts) |
| Resistance | R | R = V/I | Ω (ohms) |
| Ohm's Law | - | V = IR | - |

**Exam Tip**: Be prepared to sketch I-V characteristics from memory and explain the physical reasons for their shapes.
