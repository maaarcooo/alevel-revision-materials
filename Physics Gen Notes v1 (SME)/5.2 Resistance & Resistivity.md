# 4.2 Resistance & Resistivity - Revision Notes

## 1. Resistivity

### Basic Concepts
- **All materials have resistance** to the flow of electric charge
- As **free electrons move** through a conductor, they **collide with ions**
- These collisions cause electrons to **transfer kinetic energy**, resulting in **electrical heating**
- Since current is the flow of charge, ions resisting electron flow causes **resistance**

### The Resistivity Equation

**R = ρL/A**

Where:
- R = resistance (Ω)
- ρ = resistivity (Ω m)
- L = length of conductor (m)
- A = cross-sectional area (m²)

### Key Relationships
- **Longer wire** → **greater resistance** (R ∝ L)
- **Thicker wire** → **smaller resistance** (R ∝ 1/A)
- Doubling the length doubles the resistance
- Doubling the cross-sectional area halves the resistance

### Resistivity as a Material Property
- **Resistivity (ρ)** describes the extent to which a material opposes electric current flow
- It is an **intrinsic property** of the material
- **Temperature-dependent**
- Measured in **Ω m**

### Resistivity Values at Room Temperature

| Material Type | Material | Resistivity (Ω m) |
|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Metals** | Copper | 1.7 × 10⁻⁸ |
| | Gold | 2.4 × 10⁻⁸ |
| | Aluminium | 2.6 × 10⁻⁸ |
| **Semiconductors** | Germanium | 0.6 |
| | Silicon | 2.3 × 10³ |
| **Insulators** | Glass | 10¹² |
| | Sulfur | 10¹⁵ |

**Key points:**
- **Higher resistivity** → **higher resistance**
- **Copper** has low resistivity → used for electrical wires
- **Insulators** have extremely high resistivity → virtually no current flows

## 2. Resistance in a Thermistor

### Temperature Effects on Resistance

#### Metallic Conductors
- Solids are made of **vibrating atoms**
- **Higher temperature** → **faster atomic vibration**
- More collisions between electrons and vibrating atoms
- **Current decreases** → **resistance increases**

**For metals: ↑ Temperature → ↑ Resistance**

#### Thermistors (NTC - Negative Temperature Coefficient)
- **Non-ohmic** conductor
- Opposite behaviour to metals
- **Higher temperature** → **decreased resistance**

**For thermistors: ↑ Temperature → ↓ Resistance**

### Temperature-Resistance Graph

The thermistor graph shows:
- **Low temperature** → **high resistance**
- **High temperature** → **low resistance**
- **Non-linear** relationship
- Steep curve at lower temperatures

### Applications of Thermistors
Used as **temperature sensors** in:
- Ovens
- Fire alarms
- Digital thermometers
- Temperature control circuits

## 3. Superconductivity

### Definition
**Superconductor:** A material with **zero resistance** below a **critical temperature**

**Critical temperature (Tc):** The temperature at which a material becomes superconducting

### Key Characteristics
- All materials have some resistivity (even good conductors like copper)
- Normal conductors waste electrical energy as thermal energy
- **Resistivity can be lowered** by **lowering temperature**
- **Below critical temperature**, resistivity **disappears entirely**

### Example
- **Mercury** has a critical temperature of **4.2 K**

### Resistivity vs Temperature Graph
- **Normal metal:** Resistivity decreases gradually with decreasing temperature
- **Superconductor:** Resistivity drops to **zero** at critical temperature Tc
- Below Tc, superconductor has **zero resistivity**

### Applications of Superconductors

Superconductors are useful for applications requiring **large electric currents** and **strong magnetic fields**:

**Medical & Scientific:**
- MRI scanners
- Particle accelerators
- Fusion reactors

**Electrical & Transport:**
- Power cables (reduced energy loss)
- Transformers and generators (fewer fire risks)
- Motors
- Electromagnets
- Maglev (magnetic levitation) trains
- Monorail trains

**Technology:**
- Microchips

**Maglev Trains:**
- Use **extremely strong electromagnets** to levitate
- Can travel at speeds up to **603 km/h**
- Currently exist in Japan, South Korea, and China
- Magnets attached to both train and rails create levitation through magnetic forces

## 4. Required Practical: Investigating Resistivity

### Aim
To determine the **resistivity of a 2 m constantan wire**

### Variables
- **Independent variable:** Length (L) of wire (m)
- **Dependent variable:** Current (I) through wire (A)
- **Control variables:** 
  - Voltage through wire
  - Material of wire

### Equipment List

| Equipment | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Ammeter | Measure current through wire |
| Voltmeter | Measure voltage across wire |
| 2.0 m constantan wire (22-36 swg) | Calculate resistivity |
| Flying lead | Connect at different points along wire |
| Metre ruler | Measure wire length |
| Micrometer | Measure wire diameter |
| Power supply | Provide voltage |

**Resolution of equipment:**
- Metre ruler: 1 mm
- Micrometer: 0.01 mm
- Voltmeter: 0.1 V
- Ammeter: 0.01 A

### Method

1. **Measure wire diameter** using micrometer at 5-10 random points along the wire; calculate mean diameter

2. **Set up circuit:**
   - Wire taped/clamped to ruler with one end at 0 cm
   - Ammeter in **series**
   - Voltmeter in **parallel** to wire

3. **Attach flying lead** to test wire at 0.25 m

4. **Set power supply** to 6.0 V (verify with voltmeter)

5. **Record current** from ammeter, then **switch off immediately** (prevents heating)

6. **Vary length** in 0.25 m intervals (0.25 m, 0.50 m, 0.75 m... up to 2.0 m)
   - Aim for 8-10 readings

7. **Record current** at least **3 times** for each length; calculate **average current**

8. **Calculate resistance** for each length: **R = V/I**

### Analysis of Results

**To find resistivity:**

1. Calculate **cross-sectional area**: A = πd²/4

2. Plot graph of **Length (L)** vs **Resistance (R)**

3. Draw **line of best fit**

4. Calculate **gradient** = ρ/A

5. **Resistivity:** ρ = gradient × A

**Graph relationship:**
- From R = ρL/A, rearranging gives: R = (ρ/A) × L
- This is form y = mx where:
  - y = R
  - x = L
  - gradient m = ρ/A

### Safety Considerations
- **High current + thin wire** → wire becomes **very hot**
- **Never touch wire** when circuit is switched on
- Switch off power supply if you smell burning
- Keep liquids away from electrical equipment

### Error Minimisation

**Systematic errors:**
- Ensure wire starts at **0 on ruler** (avoid zero error)

**Random errors:**
- Use **small currents** to prevent heating (resistivity is temperature-dependent)
- **Switch off between readings** to maintain constant temperature
- Measure diameter **5-10 times** along wire and calculate mean
- Take **at least 3 current readings** per length and average

## Key Formulas Summary

| Quantity | Formula | Units |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Resistance | R = ρL/A | Ω |
| Resistivity | ρ = RA/L | Ω m |
| Cross-sectional area (circle) | A = πd²/4 | m² |
| Resistance (Ohm's Law) | R = V/I | Ω |

## Exam Tips

✓ Resistivity values are always given in exams - no need to memorise

✓ For circular wires: cross-sectional area is proportional to diameter squared (A ∝ d²)
  - If diameter doubles → area quadruples → resistance drops to 1/4

✓ Superconductivity means **zero resistance**, not "little" or "low" resistance

✓ Remember the inverse relationship for thermistors (opposite to metals)

✓ In practical: always justify why you're controlling variables (e.g., "keep temperature constant by using low current and switching off between readings")
