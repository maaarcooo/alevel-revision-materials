# 4.3 Circuits & The Potential Divider - Revision Notes

## 1. Resistors in Series & Parallel

### Resistors in Series
When resistors are connected in series, the **combined resistance equals the sum of individual resistances**:

$$R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ...$$

### Resistors in Parallel
When resistors are connected in parallel, the **reciprocal of combined resistance equals the sum of the reciprocals**:

$$\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + ...$$

**Key points:**
- As more resistors are added in parallel, combined resistance **decreases**
- Combined resistance is **less than** the smallest individual resistor
- Two equal resistors in parallel: combined resistance is **half** of one resistor

**Tip:** Remember to find the reciprocal at the end: $R = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{R_{total}}\right)}$

## 2. Series & Parallel Circuits

### Current Behaviour

**Series circuits:**
- Current is the **same** through all components
- $I_{in} = I_1 = I_2 = I_3$

**Parallel circuits:**
- Current **splits** at junctions
- Total current in = total current out (Kirchhoff's First Law)
- $I_{in} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3$
- Current in each branch depends on the resistance of that branch

### Voltage Behaviour

**Series circuits:**
- Voltage is **split** across components
- Share depends on resistance (larger R gets larger V)
- $V_{in} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3$

**Parallel circuits:**
- Voltage is the **same** across all branches
- $V_{in} = V_1 = V_2 = V_3$

### Summary Table

| Property | Series | Parallel |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Current** | Same throughout: $I_{in} = I_1 = I_2$ | Splits at junctions: $I_{in} = I_1 + I_2$ |
| **Voltage** | Split across components: $V_{in} = V_1 + V_2$ | Same across branches: $V_{in} = V_1 = V_2$ |
| **Resistance** | $R_{total} = R_1 + R_2$ | $\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}$ |

## 3. Conservation Laws

### Conservation of Charge (Kirchhoff's First Law)
**At any junction in a circuit:**
- Total current entering = total current leaving
- Charge is never created or destroyed

**Application:** Parallel circuits at junctions

### Conservation of Energy (Kirchhoff's Second Law)
**In any closed loop:**
- Total e.m.f. = sum of potential differences across all components
- Energy is never created or destroyed

**Application:**
- Series circuits: $V_{supply} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3$
- Each loop in parallel circuits can be treated as a series circuit

**Practical benefit:** Parallel circuits are ideal for home wiring:
- All appliances receive the same voltage
- If one device fails, others continue working

## 4. Electrical Energy & Power

### Power Definitions
**Power** is the rate of doing work or energy transferred per second:

$$P = \frac{E}{t} = \frac{W}{t}$$

### Power Equations
Three forms, all equivalent:

$$P = IV$$

$$P = I^2R$$

$$P = \frac{V^2}{R}$$

**Where:**
- P = power (W)
- I = current (A)
- V = voltage (V)
- R = resistance (Ω)

**Important:** If current or voltage doubles, power increases by a factor of **four** (due to the squared relationship).

### Energy Equation

$$E = VIt$$

**Where:**
- E = energy transferred (J)
- V = voltage (V)
- I = current (A)
- t = time (s)

**Note:** Time must be in **seconds** for energy in joules.

**Memory aid:** "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Power equals I squared R"

## 5. Potential Divider Circuits

### Purpose
Potential dividers produce an **output voltage as a fraction of input voltage**.

**Uses:**
- Provide variable potential difference
- Select specific voltages
- Split voltage of power supply between components
- Sensor circuits (LDRs, thermistors)
- Volume controls

### Potential Divider Equation

$$V_{out} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \times V_{in}$$

**Or alternatively:**

$$V_{out} = \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} \times V_{in}$$

**Critical rule:** The numerator must be the resistance of the resistor **across which $V_{out}$ is measured**.

### Key Principles
- Component with **larger resistance** receives **larger p.d.** (from V = IR)
- If one resistor's resistance increases:
  - Its p.d. **increases**
  - The other resistor's p.d. **decreases**
- P.d. across a component is **proportional** to its resistance

## 6. Variable Resistance Components

### Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
**Behaviour:**
- Resistance **decreases** as light intensity **increases**
- Resistance **increases** as light intensity **decreases**

**Applications:**
- Street lights
- Security lights
- Light sensors

### Thermistor (NTC - Negative Temperature Coefficient)
**Behaviour:**
- Resistance **decreases** as temperature **increases**
- Resistance **increases** as temperature **decreases**

**Applications:**
- Fire alarms
- Ovens
- Digital thermometers
- Temperature sensors

### Using Sensors in Potential Dividers
When an LDR or thermistor is used in a potential divider:

1. As sensor resistance **decreases** → its p.d. **decreases**
2. As sensor resistance **increases** → its p.d. **increases**
3. Since total voltage is constant (Kirchhoff's Second Law):
   - If sensor p.d. decreases → fixed resistor p.d. **increases**
   - If sensor p.d. increases → fixed resistor p.d. **decreases**

This allows external components to switch on/off automatically based on environmental conditions.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Parallel resistors:** Forgetting to find the reciprocal at the end (finding 1/R instead of R)
2. **Series circuits:** Thinking voltage is same through all components (it's current that's the same)
3. **Parallel circuits:** Thinking current is same in all branches (it's voltage that's the same)
4. **Kirchhoff's Laws:** Not accounting for all components or junctions
5. **Potential divider:** Using wrong resistor in numerator
6. **Power calculations:** Not converting time to seconds
7. **Circuit analysis:** Not checking that sum of voltages equals supply e.m.f.

## Exam Tips

- **Annotate circuit diagrams** with known values to identify missing quantities
- **Draw current direction arrows** on parallel circuits to clarify junction analysis
- **Check your work** using Kirchhoff's Laws
- **Remember:** In potential dividers, the resistor you're measuring across goes in the numerator
- **Use Ohm's Law** (V = IR) alongside potential divider equations
- For parallel resistors, use calculator's reciprocal button (x⁻¹ or 1/x)
