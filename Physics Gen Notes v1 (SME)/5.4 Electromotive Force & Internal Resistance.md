# 4.4 Electromotive Force & Internal Resistance

## Electromotive Force (EMF)

**Definition:** The amount of chemical energy converted to electrical energy per coulomb of charge when passing through a power supply.

$$\varepsilon = \frac{E}{Q}$$

Where:
- ε = EMF (V)
- E = energy transformed (J)
- Q = charge (C)

**Key Points:**
- Symbol: **ε** (epsilon, Greek letter)
- Unit: **volts (V)**
- Despite the name, EMF is **not a force**
- EMF equals the potential difference across the cell when **no current flows**
- Measured using a **high-resistance voltmeter** in an **open circuit**

---

## Terminal Potential Difference

**Definition:** The potential difference across the terminals of a cell.

$$V = IR$$

Where:
- V = terminal p.d. (V)
- I = current (A)
- R = load resistance (Ω)

**Important:** Since cells have internal resistance, the terminal p.d. is **always lower** than the EMF when current flows. If there were no internal resistance, terminal p.d. would equal EMF.

---

## Internal Resistance

**Definition:** The resistance of the materials within the battery.

**Symbol:** r (Ω)

**Effects:**
- Causes circulating charge to dissipate electrical energy within the power supply
- Makes the cell warm up over time
- Causes loss of voltage/energy in the power supply

**Circuit Model:** A cell can be represented as an EMF source (ε) with internal resistance (r) connected in series.

---

## Lost Volts

**Definition:** The work done per unit charge to overcome the internal resistance when current flows.

**Symbol:** v (lowercase)

$$v = Ir$$

This represents the **voltage lost in the cell** due to internal resistance.

**From energy conservation:**

$$v = \varepsilon - V$$

Therefore:

$$v = \varepsilon - V = Ir$$

---

## Key Equation: EMF, Terminal p.d., and Internal Resistance

The EMF is the sum of the terminal p.d. and the lost volts:

$$\varepsilon = V + v$$

$$\varepsilon = IR + Ir$$

$$\varepsilon = I(R + r)$$

Where:
- ε = EMF (V)
- V = terminal p.d. (V)
- I = current (A)
- R = load resistance (Ω)
- r = internal resistance (Ω)

**Therefore:** EMF is the **total** or **maximum** voltage available to the circuit.

## Worked Example

**Problem:** A battery of EMF 7.3 V and internal resistance 0.3 Ω is connected in series with a resistor of resistance 9.5 Ω. Determine:
a) The current in the circuit
b) Lost volts from the battery

**Solution:**

**a) Current:**

Using: ε = I(R + r)

Rearrange: 
$$I = \frac{\varepsilon}{R + r} = \frac{7.3}{9.5 + 0.3} = \frac{7.3}{9.8} = 0.745 \text{ A} = 0.7 \text{ A (2 s.f.)}$$

**b) Lost volts:**

Using: Lost volts = Ir

$$v = 0.7 \times 0.3 = 0.21 \text{ V} = 0.2 \text{ V (2 s.f.)}$$

## Required Practical: Investigating EMF & Internal Resistance

### Aim
Investigate the relationship between EMF and internal resistance by measuring the variation of current and voltage using a variable resistor.

### Variables
- **Independent variable:** Resistance, R (Ω)
- **Dependent variables:** Voltage, V (V) and current, I (A)
- **Control variables:** EMF of the cell, internal resistance of the cell

### Equipment
- 1.5 V cell
- Resistor (unknown resistance - acts as internal resistance)
- 100Ω variable resistor
- Voltmeter (0-2 V range, resolution 1 mV)
- Ammeter (0-200 mA range, resolution 0.1 mA)
- Wires (at least 6 leads)
- Switch

### Method
1. Connect the cell and resistor r in series (consider as single cell with internal resistance)
2. With switch **open**, record voltage V on voltmeter (this is the EMF)
3. Set variable resistor to **maximum value**, close switch and record V and I
4. **Open switch between readings** to prevent battery heating
5. Vary the resistance of the variable resistor and take **8-10 readings** across the full range

## Analysing the Results

Starting with the fundamental equation:

$$\varepsilon = I(R + r)$$

This simplifies to:

$$\varepsilon = IR + Ir = V + Ir$$

Rearranging for V:

$$V = -rI + \varepsilon$$

**Comparing to straight line equation y = mx + c:**

- **y = V** (terminal p.d.)
- **x = I** (current)
- **Gradient = -r** (negative internal resistance)
- **Y-intercept = ε** (EMF)

### Graph Analysis
1. Plot V (y-axis) against I (x-axis)
2. Draw a line of best fit
3. Calculate the gradient using the largest possible triangle
4. **Internal resistance, r = |gradient|** (take absolute value)
5. **EMF, ε = y-intercept**

The graph shows a **negative linear relationship** between V and I, indicating that as current increases, terminal voltage decreases due to lost volts across internal resistance.

## Evaluating the Experiment

### Systematic Errors
**Issue:** Internal resistance changes if battery heats up

**Solution:** Only close the switch for as long as needed to take readings

### Random Errors
**Solutions:**
- Use **fairly new cells** (old batteries have variable EMF and internal resistance)
- **Wait for readings to stabilize** before recording values
- Take **at least 3 repeat readings** for each setting and calculate mean

### Safety Considerations
- Electrical components can get hot during prolonged use
- **Switch off immediately** if you smell burning
- Keep liquids away from electrical equipment

## Examiner Tips

- If a question states **"a battery of negligible internal resistance"**, assume EMF = terminal voltage and internal resistance calculations are not needed
- If the circuit diagram includes internal resistance, **EMF equations must be used**
- When calculating gradient, use the **largest triangle possible** to minimize percentage uncertainty
- Remember the gradient is **negative**, so internal resistance r = |gradient|
- Always include appropriate **units** and **significant figures** in your answers
