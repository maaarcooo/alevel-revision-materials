# 1. Measurements & Their Errors

## 1.1 Uses of SI Units and Their Prefixes

### SI Base Units

**SI units** are the fundamental units of measurement:

| Quantity | Symbol | SI Unit |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Mass | m | kg (kilograms) |
| Length | l | m (metres) |
| Time | t | s (seconds) |
| Amount of substance | n | mol (moles) |
| Temperature | T | K (kelvin) |
| Electric current | I | A (amperes) |

### Deriving SI Units

The SI units of quantities can be **derived** from their defining equations.

**Example 1: Force**

From $F = ma$:

$$\text{Units of } F = \text{kg} \times \text{m s}^{-2} = \text{kg m s}^{-2} \text{ (also known as N)}$$

**Example 2: Voltage**

From $V = \frac{E}{Q}$ where $E$ is energy and $Q$ is charge:

- Energy: $E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ gives units $\text{kg m}^2 \text{s}^{-2}$
- Charge: $Q = It$ gives units $\text{A s}$
- Therefore: $V = \frac{\text{kg m}^2 \text{s}^{-2}}{\text{A s}} = \text{kg m}^2 \text{s}^{-3} \text{A}^{-1}$

### SI Prefixes

| Name | Symbol | Multiplier |
|------|--------|------------|
| Tera | T | $10^{12}$ |
| Giga | G | $10^{9}$ |
| Mega | M | $10^{6}$ |
| Kilo | k | $10^{3}$ |
| Centi | c | $10^{-2}$ |
| Milli | m | $10^{-3}$ |
| Micro | μ | $10^{-6}$ |
| Nano | n | $10^{-9}$ |
| Pico | p | $10^{-12}$ |
| Femto | f | $10^{-15}$ |

**Examples:**
- 6 pF (picofarads) = $6 \times 10^{-12}$ F
- 9 GΩ (gigaohms) = $9 \times 10^{9}$ Ω
- 10 μm (micrometres) = $10 \times 10^{-6}$ m

### Unit Conversions

**Electron volts to joules:**

$$1 \text{ eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$$

*Example:* Convert 76 MeV to joules:
1. Convert MeV to eV: $76 \times 10^6$ eV
2. Convert to joules: $76 \times 10^6 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} = 1.216 \times 10^{-11}$ J

**Kilowatt hours to joules:**

$$1 \text{ kWh} = 1000 \text{ J/s} \times 3600 \text{ s} = 3.6 \times 10^6 \text{ J} = 3.6 \text{ MJ}$$

## 1.2 Limitation of Physical Measurements

### Types of Error

#### Random Errors

**Random errors** affect **precision**, causing differences in measurements which produce a spread about the mean. Random errors **cannot** be completely eliminated.

*Example:* Electronic noise in the circuit of an electrical instrument.

**To reduce random errors:**
- Take **at least 3 repeats** and calculate a **mean** (this also allows anomalies to be identified)
- Use **computers/data loggers/cameras** to reduce human error and enable smaller intervals
- Use **appropriate equipment** (e.g., a micrometer has higher resolution of 0.01 mm than a ruler at 1 mm)

#### Systematic Errors

**Systematic errors** affect **accuracy** and occur due to the apparatus or faults in the experimental method. They cause all results to be **too high or too low by the same amount** each time.

*Examples:*
- A balance that isn't zeroed correctly (**zero error**)
- Reading a scale at a different angle (**parallax error**)

**To reduce systematic errors:**
- **Calibrate** apparatus by measuring a known value (e.g., weigh 1 kg on a mass balance)
- In radiation experiments, correct for **background radiation** by measuring it beforehand and excluding it from final results
- Read the **meniscus** at eye level to reduce parallax error
- Use **controls** in experiments

### Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Precision** | Precise measurements are consistent; they fluctuate slightly about a mean value (this doesn't indicate the value is accurate) |
| **Repeatability** | If the original experimenter can redo the experiment with the same equipment and method and get the same results, it is repeatable |
| **Reproducibility** | If the experiment is redone by a different person or with different techniques and equipment and the same results are found, it is reproducible |
| **Resolution** | The smallest change in the quantity being measured that gives a recognisable change in reading |
| **Accuracy** | A measurement close to the true value is accurate |

### Uncertainty

The **uncertainty** of a measurement is the bounds in which the accurate value can be expected to lie.

*Example:* $20°\text{C} \pm 2°\text{C}$ means the true value could be within 18–22°C.

**Types of Uncertainty:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Absolute Uncertainty** | Uncertainty given as a fixed quantity | $7 \pm 0.6$ V |
| **Fractional Uncertainty** | Uncertainty as a fraction of the measurement | $7 \pm \frac{3}{35}$ V |
| **Percentage Uncertainty** | Uncertainty as a percentage of the measurement | $7 \pm 8.6\%$ V |

To reduce percentage and fractional uncertainty, measure larger quantities.

### Resolution and Uncertainty

**Readings** are when one value is found (e.g., reading a thermometer).

**Measurements** are when the difference between two readings is found (e.g., using a ruler where both start and end points are judged).

**Rules for uncertainty:**

- **Uncertainty in a reading** = $\pm$ half the smallest division
  - *Example:* Thermometer with 1°C divisions has uncertainty $\pm 0.5°\text{C}$

- **Uncertainty in a measurement** = at least $\pm 1$ smallest division
  - *Example:* Ruler has $\pm 0.5$ mm at each end, so total uncertainty is $\pm 1$ mm

- **Digital readings** and given values: uncertainty is either quoted or assumed to be $\pm$ the last significant digit
  - *Example:* 3.2 V has uncertainty $\pm 0.1$ V

- **Repeated data:** uncertainty = half the range

$$\text{Result} = \text{mean} \pm \frac{\text{range}}{2}$$

**Reducing uncertainty:**
- Fix one end of a ruler (only one reading uncertainty)
- Measure multiple instances (e.g., time 10 pendulum swings, then divide both value and uncertainty by 10)

**Important:** Uncertainties should be given to the **same number of significant figures** as the data.

### Combining Uncertainties

#### Adding or Subtracting Data: ADD ABSOLUTE UNCERTAINTIES

*Example:* Temperature falls from $298 \pm 0.5$ K to $273 \pm 0.5$ K.

$$\Delta T = 298 - 273 = 25 \text{ K}$$
$$\text{Uncertainty} = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \text{ K}$$
$$\text{Result} = 25 \pm 1 \text{ K}$$

#### Multiplying or Dividing Data: ADD PERCENTAGE UNCERTAINTIES

*Example:* Force $F = 91 \pm 3$ N applied to mass $m = 7 \pm 0.2$ kg.

$$a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{91}{7} = 13 \text{ m s}^{-2}$$

$$\text{\% uncertainty} = \frac{\text{uncertainty}}{\text{value}} \times 100$$

$$\text{\% uncertainty in } F = \frac{3}{91} \times 100 = 3.3\%$$

$$\text{\% uncertainty in } m = \frac{0.2}{7} \times 100 = 2.9\%$$

$$\text{Total \% uncertainty} = 3.3\% + 2.9\% = 6.2\%$$

$$a = 13 \pm 6.2\% \text{ m s}^{-2} = 13 \pm 0.8 \text{ m s}^{-2}$$

#### Raising to a Power: MULTIPLY PERCENTAGE UNCERTAINTY BY POWER

*Example:* Radius $r = 5 \pm 0.3$ cm. Find percentage uncertainty in area.

$$A = \pi r^2 = \pi \times 25 = 78.5 \text{ cm}^2$$

$$\text{\% uncertainty in } r = \frac{0.3}{5} \times 100 = 6\%$$

$$\text{\% uncertainty in } A = 6\% \times 2 = 12\%$$

$$A = 78.5 \pm 12\% \text{ cm}^2$$

### Uncertainties and Graphs

Uncertainties are shown as **error bars** on graphs. A **line of best fit** should go through all error bars (excluding **anomalous points**).

**Finding uncertainty in gradient:**

1. Draw a **steepest** and **shallowest** line of worst fit (must go through all error bars)
2. Calculate the gradient of lines of best and worst fit

$$\text{Percentage uncertainty} = \frac{|\text{best gradient} - \text{worst gradient}|}{\text{best gradient}} \times 100\%$$

*Alternative method using max/min gradients:*

$$\text{Percentage uncertainty} = \frac{\text{max gradient} - \text{min gradient}}{2} \times 100\%$$

**Finding uncertainty in y-intercept:**

$$\text{Percentage uncertainty} = \frac{|\text{best y-intercept} - \text{worst y-intercept}|}{\text{best y-intercept}} \times 100\%$$

## 1.3 Estimation of Physical Quantities

### Orders of Magnitude

**Orders of magnitude** are powers of ten which describe the size of an object and can be used to compare the sizes of objects.

*Examples:*
- Diameter of nuclei: order of magnitude $\sim 10^{-14}$ m
- 100 m is **two orders of magnitude** greater than 1 m

**Finding order of magnitude:**

Calculate the value and express it as a power of ten only.

*Example:* Diameter of hydrogen atom = $1.06 \times 10^{-10}$ m. Find the area to the nearest order of magnitude (assuming spherical).

$$A = \pi r^2 = \pi \times (0.53 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 8.82 \times 10^{-21} \text{ m}^2$$

$$\approx 1 \times 10^{-20} \text{ m}^2$$

Order of magnitude = $10^{-20}$ m²

### Estimation

**Estimation** is a skill physicists use to approximate the values of physical quantities in order to:
- Make comparisons between quantities
- Check if a calculated value is reasonable
