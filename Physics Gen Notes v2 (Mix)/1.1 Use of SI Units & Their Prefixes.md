# 1.1 Use of SI Units & Their Prefixes

## SI Base Quantities

There is a seemingly endless number of units in Physics. These can all be reduced to **seven base units** from which every other unit can be derived. Only **six** of these are required for the AQA A-Level course.

These seven units are referred to as the **SI Base Units** — this is the only system of measurement that is officially used in almost every country around the world.

### SI Base Quantities Table

| Quantity | SI Base Unit | Symbol |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Mass | kilogram | kg |
| Length | metre | m |
| Time | second | s |
| Current | ampere | A |
| Temperature | kelvin | K |
| Amount of substance | mole | mol |

## Derived Units

**Derived units** are derived from the seven SI Base units.

The base units of physical quantities such as Newtons (N), Joules (J), and Pascals (Pa) can be deduced.

To deduce the base units, it is necessary to use the **definition of the quantity**.

### The Newton (N)

The Newton, the unit of force, is defined by the equation:

$$\text{Force} = \text{mass} \times \text{acceleration}$$

$$\text{N} = \text{kg} \times \text{m s}^{-2} = \text{kg m s}^{-2}$$

Therefore, the Newton (N) in SI base units is **kg m s⁻²**

### The Joule (J)

The Joule, the unit of energy, is defined by the equation:

$$\text{Energy} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{mass} \times \text{velocity}^2$$

$$\text{J} = \text{kg} \times (\text{m s}^{-1})^2 = \text{kg m}^2 \text{ s}^{-2}$$

Therefore, the Joule (J) in SI base units is **kg m² s⁻²**

### The Pascal (Pa)

The Pascal, the unit of pressure, is defined by the equation:

$$\text{Pressure} = \frac{\text{force}}{\text{area}}$$

$$\text{Pa} = \text{N} \div \text{m}^2 = (\text{kg m s}^{-2}) \div \text{m}^2 = \text{kg m}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-2}$$

Therefore, the Pascal (Pa) in SI base units is **kg m⁻¹ s⁻²**

## Powers of Ten

Physical quantities can span a huge range of values. For example, the diameter of an atom is about $10^{-10}$ m, whereas the width of a galaxy may be about $10^{21}$ m — a difference of 31 powers of ten.

**Powers of ten** are numbers that can be achieved by multiplying 10 by itself.

It is useful to know the **prefixes** for certain powers of ten.

### Powers of Ten Table

| Prefix | Abbreviation | Value |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| tera | T | $10^{12}$ |
| giga | G | $10^{9}$ |
| mega | M | $10^{6}$ |
| kilo | k | $10^{3}$ |
| centi | c | $10^{-2}$ |
| milli | m | $10^{-3}$ |
| micro | μ | $10^{-6}$ |
| nano | n | $10^{-9}$ |
| pico | p | $10^{-12}$ |
| femto | f | $10^{-15}$ |

### Examples

- 5 kN = 5 kilonewtons = $5 \times 10^3$ N (5000 N)
- 7 nC = 7 nanocoulombs = $7 \times 10^{-9}$ C (0.000000007 C)

## Common Unit Conversions

### Joules (J) and Electronvolts (eV)

A common unit conversion in physics is between Joules (J) and **electronvolts (eV)**.

The electronvolt is derived from the equation for work done (or energy transferred): $W = qV$

$$1 \text{ eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C} \times 1 \text{ V} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$$

**Conversion rules:**

- To convert from J → eV: **divide** by $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$
- To convert from eV → J: **multiply** by $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$

#### Worked Example

The ionisation energy of hydrogen is $2.176 \times 10^{-18}$ J. Calculate this energy in eV.

**Solution:**

To convert from J → eV, divide by $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ J

$$\text{Energy in eV} = \frac{2.176 \times 10^{-18}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 13.6 \text{ eV}$$

### Joules (J) and Kilowatt-hours (kW h)

Another common unit conversion in physics is between Joules (J) and kilowatt-hours (kW h).

To convert between J and kW h, expand the derived units and re-collect terms:

- 1 kW h = 3600 kW s (since 1 hour = 3600 s)
- 3600 kW s = 3 600 000 W s (since 1 kW = 1000 W)
- 3 600 000 W s = 3 600 000 J = 3.6 MJ (since power = energy / time, so 1 W = 1 J s⁻¹)

**Conversion rules:**

- To convert from J → kW h: **divide** by $3.6 \times 10^{6}$
- To convert from kW h → J: **multiply** by $3.6 \times 10^{6}$

## Orders of Magnitude

When a number is expressed in an **order of 10**, this is an **order of magnitude**.

- Example: If a number is described as $3 \times 10^8$, then that number is actually $3 \times 100\,000\,000$
- The **order of magnitude** of $3 \times 10^8$ is just $10^8$

Orders of magnitude follow **rules for rounding**:

- The order of magnitude of $6 \times 10^8$ is $10^9$ as the magnitude is **rounded up**

A quantity is an **order of magnitude larger** than another quantity if it is about **ten times larger**.

- Similarly, **two orders of magnitude** would be **100 times larger**, or $10^2$

When **estimating values**, it's best to give the estimate of an order of magnitude to the **nearest power of 10**.

### Order of Magnitudes Table

| Object of Interest | Approximate Length (m) | Order of Magnitude (m) |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Distance to the edge of the observable universe | $4.40 \times 10^{26}$ | $10^{26}$ |
| Distance from Earth to Neptune | $4.5 \times 10^{12}$ | $10^{12}$ |
| Distance from London to Cape Town | $9.7 \times 10^{6}$ | $10^{7}$ |
| The length of a human | 1.7 | $10^{0}$ |
| The length of an ant | $9 \times 10^{-4}$ | $10^{-3}$ |
| The length of a bacteria | $2 \times 10^{-6}$ | $10^{-6}$ |

### Worked Example

Estimate the order of magnitude for the following quantities:

1. The temperature of the surface of the Sun in Kelvin
2. The power of a standard lightbulb
3. The volume of the room you are in now

**Solutions:**

1. **Temperature of the surface of the Sun in Kelvin**
   - The temperature of the surface of the Sun is about 6000 K
   - This is an order of magnitude of ~ $10^4$ K

2. **Power of a standard lightbulb**
   - The power of a standard lightbulb is about 60 W
   - This is an order of magnitude of ~ $10^2$ W

3. **Volume of the room you are in now**
   - The shape should roughly be cubic or (rectangular) cuboid
   - Volume = length × width × height
   - For a cubic room with length 3 m: volume = $3^3 = 27$ m³
   - This is an order of magnitude of ~ $10^1$ m³

## Estimating Physical Quantities

There are important physical quantities to learn in physics. It is useful to know these physical quantities — they are particularly useful when making **estimates**.

| Wavelength of UV light | 10 nm |
| Height of an adult human | 2 m |
| Distance between the Earth and the Sun (1 AU) | $1.5 \times 10^{11}$ m |
| Mass of a hydrogen atom | $10^{-27}$ kg |
| Mass of an adult human | 70 kg |
| Mass of a car | 1000 kg |
| Seconds in a day | 90 000 s |
| Seconds in a year | $3 \times 10^{7}$ s |
| Speed of sound in air | 300 m s⁻¹ |
| Power of a lightbulb | 60 W |
| Atmospheric pressure | $1 \times 10^{5}$ Pa |

### Worked Example

Estimate the energy required for an adult man to walk up a flight of stairs.

**Solution:**

The energy required to overcome gravitational potential is equal to $mgh$

- Mass of an adult man ~ 70 kg
- Height of staircase ~ 3 m
- $g$ ~ 10 N kg⁻¹

$$\text{Energy} \approx 70 \times 10 \times 3 = 2100 \text{ J}$$

## Exam Tips

- You will only be required to use the **six SI base units** given in the table in this course — make sure you know them!
- You will often see very large or very small numbers categorised by powers of ten, so it is very important you become familiar with these as **getting these prefixes wrong is a very common exam mistake**!
