# 1.2 Limitation of Physical Measurements

## Sources of Uncertainty

### Random and Systematic Errors

Measurements of quantities are made with the aim of finding the **true value** of that quantity. In reality, it is impossible to obtain the true value of any quantity as there will always be a degree of uncertainty.

**Uncertainty** is an estimate of the difference between a measurement reading and the true value.

Random and systematic errors are two types of measurement errors that lead to uncertainty.

#### Random Error

Random errors cause unpredictable fluctuations in an instrument's readings as a result of uncontrollable factors, such as environmental conditions.

This affects the **precision** of the measurements taken, causing a wider spread of results about the mean value.

**To reduce random error:**

- **Repeat** measurements several times and calculate an average from them

#### Systematic Error

Systematic errors arise from the use of faulty instruments or from flaws in the experimental method.

This type of error is repeated consistently every time the instrument is used or the method is followed, which affects the **accuracy** of all readings obtained.

**To reduce systematic errors:**

- Instruments should be **recalibrated**, or different instruments should be used
- Corrections or adjustments should be made to the technique

### Zero Error

A **zero error** is a type of systematic error which occurs when an instrument gives a reading when the **true reading is zero**.

This introduces a fixed error into readings which must be accounted for when the results are recorded.

## Precision and Accuracy

### Precision

**Precise** measurements are ones in which there is very little spread about the mean value, in other words, how close the measured values are to each other.

If a measurement is repeated several times, it can be described as precise when the values are very similar to, or the same as, each other.

The precision of a measurement is reflected in the values recorded — measurements to a greater number of decimal places are said to be more **precise** than those to a whole number.

### Accuracy

A measurement is considered **accurate** if it is close to the true value.

The accuracy can be increased by repeating measurements and finding a mean of the results.

Repeating measurements also helps to identify **anomalies** that can be omitted from the final results.

> **Exam Tip:** It is a very common mistake to confuse precision with accuracy — measurements can be precise but **not** accurate if each measurement reading has the same error. Precision refers to the ability to take multiple readings with an instrument that are close to each other, whereas accuracy is the closeness of those measurements to the true value.

### Repeatability

A measurement is **repeatable** if the original experimenter repeats the investigation using the same method and equipment and obtains the same results.

### Reproducibility

A measurement is **reproducible** if the investigation is repeated by another person, or by using different equipment or techniques, and the same results are obtained.

### Resolution

**Resolution** is the smallest change in the quantity being measured of a measuring instrument that gives a perceptible change in the reading.

For example, the resolution of a wristwatch is 1 s, whereas the resolution of a digital stopclock is typically 10 ms (0.01 s).

In imaging, resolution can also be described as the ability to see two structures as two separate structures rather than as one fuzzy entity.

## Calculating Uncertainties

### Understanding Uncertainty

There is always a degree of uncertainty when measurements are taken; the uncertainty can be thought of as the difference between the **actual** reading taken (caused by the equipment or techniques used) and the **true value**.

Uncertainties are **not** the same as errors:

- **Errors** can be thought of as issues with equipment or methodology that cause a reading to be different from the true value
- **Uncertainty** is a range of values around a measurement within which the true value is expected to lie, and is an **estimate**

### Types of Uncertainty

Uncertainties can be represented in several ways:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Absolute Uncertainty** | Uncertainty given as a fixed quantity | $I = 1.6 \pm 0.1 \text{ mA}$ |
| **Fractional Uncertainty** | Uncertainty given as a fraction of the measurement | $I = 1.6 \pm \frac{1}{16} \text{ mA}$ |
| **Percentage Uncertainty** | Uncertainty given as a percentage of the measurement | $I = 1.6 \pm 6.2\% \text{ mA}$ |

### Calculating Percentage Uncertainty

$$\text{Percentage uncertainty} = \frac{\text{uncertainty}}{\text{measured value}} \times 100\%$$

### Finding Uncertainties in Different Situations

| Situation | Uncertainty |
|-----------|-------------|
| Uncertainty in a **reading** | $\pm$ half the smallest division |
| Uncertainty in a **measurement** | At least $\pm 1$ smallest division |
| Uncertainty in **repeated data** | Half the range: $\pm \frac{1}{2}(\text{largest} - \text{smallest value})$ |
| Uncertainty in **digital readings** | $\pm$ the last significant digit (unless otherwise quoted) |

> **Exam Tip:** 
> - Absolute uncertainties (denoted by Δ) have the same units as the quantity
> - Percentage uncertainties have no units
> - The uncertainty in numbers and constants, such as π, is taken to be zero
> - Absolute uncertainties should always be quoted to **one significant figure**
> - Fractional and percentage uncertainties should be quoted to **no more than two significant figures**
> - The number of significant figures in the final result must be rounded to match the precision of the absolute uncertainty

## Combining Uncertainties

### Adding or Subtracting Data

When adding or subtracting quantities, **add together the absolute uncertainties**.

**Example:**
- Diameter of tyre: $d_1 = 55.0 \pm 0.5 \text{ cm}$
- Diameter of inner tyre: $d_2 = 21.0 \pm 0.7 \text{ cm}$
- Difference: $d_1 - d_2 = 55.0 - 21.0 = 34.0 \text{ cm}$
- Uncertainty in difference: $\pm(0.5 + 0.7) = \pm 1.2 \text{ cm}$
- **Result:** $d_1 - d_2 = 34.0 \pm 1.2 \text{ cm}$

### Multiplying or Dividing Data

When multiplying or dividing quantities, **add the percentage or fractional uncertainties**.

**Example:**
- Distance: $s = 50.0 \pm 0.1 \text{ m}$
- Time: $t = 5.00 \pm 0.05 \text{ s}$
- Speed: $v = \frac{s}{t} = \frac{50.0}{5.0} = 10.0 \text{ m s}^{-1}$

$$\frac{\Delta v}{v} = \frac{\Delta s}{s} + \frac{\Delta t}{t} = \frac{0.1}{50.0} + \frac{0.05}{5.00} = 0.002 + 0.01 = 0.012$$

- Absolute uncertainty: $\Delta v = 10.0 \times 0.012 = \pm 0.12 \text{ m s}^{-1}$
- **Result:** $v = 10.0 \pm 0.12 \text{ m s}^{-1}$

### Raising to a Power

When raising a quantity to a power, **multiply the percentage uncertainty by the power**.

**Example:**
- Radius: $r = 2.50 \pm 0.02 \text{ cm}$
- Volume of sphere: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi(2.50)^3 = 65.5 \text{ cm}^3$

$$\frac{\Delta V}{V} = 3 \times \frac{\Delta r}{r} = 3 \times \frac{0.02}{2.50} = 0.024$$

- Absolute uncertainty: $\Delta V = 65.5 \times 0.024 = 1.57 \text{ cm}^3$
- Percentage uncertainty: $\%\Delta V = 100 \times 0.024 = 2.4\%$

### Worked Example: Uncertainty in Repeated Measurements

A student achieves the following results for angular frequency, ω:
$$0.154, \quad 0.153, \quad 0.159, \quad 0.147, \quad 0.152$$

**Calculate the percentage uncertainty in the mean value of ω.**

**Step 1:** Calculate the mean value
$$\text{mean } \omega = \frac{0.154 + 0.153 + 0.159 + 0.147 + 0.152}{5} = 0.153 \text{ rad s}^{-1}$$

**Step 2:** Calculate half the range (uncertainty for multiple readings)
$$\text{uncertainty in } \omega = \frac{1}{2} \times (0.159 - 0.147) = 0.006 \text{ rad s}^{-1}$$

**Step 3:** Calculate percentage uncertainty
$$\frac{\text{uncertainty}}{\text{measured value}} \times 100\% = \frac{0.006}{0.153} \times 100\% = 3.92\% \approx 4\%$$

**Result:** $\omega = 0.153 \text{ rad s}^{-1} \pm 4\%$

## Determining Uncertainties from Graphs

### Using Error Bars

The uncertainty in a measurement can be shown on a graph as an **error bar**.

- This bar is drawn above and below the point (or from side to side) and shows the uncertainty in that measurement
- Error bars are plotted on graphs to show the **absolute uncertainty** of values plotted
- Usually, error bars will be in the vertical direction (for y-values), but can also be plotted horizontally (for x-values)

### Finding Uncertainty in the Gradient

To calculate the uncertainty in a gradient, two lines of best fit should be drawn on the graph:

1. **The 'best' line of best fit** — which passes as close to the points as possible
2. **The 'worst' line of best fit** — either the steepest possible or the shallowest possible line which fits within all the error bars

**Percentage uncertainty in the gradient:**

$$\text{Percentage uncertainty} = \frac{\text{best gradient} - \text{worst gradient}}{\text{best gradient}} \times 100\%$$

### Finding Uncertainty in the Y-Intercept

**Percentage uncertainty in the y-intercept:**

$$\text{Percentage uncertainty} = \frac{\text{best y-intercept} - \text{worst y-intercept}}{\text{best y-intercept}} \times 100\%$$

### Graph Drawing Guidelines

When drawing graphs, ensure you:

- Use a sensible scale that takes up as much paper as possible
- Label the axes with a quantity and a unit
- Precisely plot the points to within 0.5 squares
- Leave a roughly equal number of points above and below the best fit line
- Draw the error bars accurately
