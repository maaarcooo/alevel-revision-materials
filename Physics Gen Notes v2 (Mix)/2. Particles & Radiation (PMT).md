# 2. Particles & Radiation

## 2.1 Particles

### 2.1.1 Constituents of the Atom

An atom consists of three fundamental constituents: **protons**, **neutrons**, and **electrons**. The nucleus, located at the centre of the atom, contains protons and neutrons (collectively known as **nucleons**), while electrons orbit the nucleus in shells.

#### Particle Properties

| Particle | Charge (C) | Relative Charge | Mass (kg) | Relative Mass | Specific Charge (C kg⁻¹) |
|----------|------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Proton | $+1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ | +1 | $1.67 \times 10^{-27}$ | 1 | $9.58 \times 10^{7}$ |
| Neutron | 0 | 0 | $1.67 \times 10^{-27}$ | 1 | 0 |
| Electron | $-1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ | -1 | $9.11 \times 10^{-31}$ | 0.0005 | $1.76 \times 10^{11}$ |

#### Specific Charge

The **specific charge** of a particle is the charge-to-mass ratio:

$$\text{Specific charge} = \frac{\text{Charge}}{\text{Mass}}$$

**Example:** For a proton with charge $+1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C and mass $1.67 \times 10^{-27}$ kg:

$$\text{Specific charge} = \frac{1.6 \times 10^{-19}}{1.67 \times 10^{-27}} = 9.58 \times 10^{7} \text{ C kg}^{-1}$$

#### Nuclear Notation

- **Proton number (Z):** The number of protons in an atom
- **Nucleon number (A):** The total number of protons and neutrons

Notation: $^{A}_{Z}X$ where X is the element symbol.

#### Isotopes

**Isotopes** are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.

**Carbon dating** uses the radioactive isotope carbon-14 to determine the approximate age of organic materials. This involves calculating the percentage of carbon-14 remaining and using its known half-life to estimate age.

### 2.1.2 Stable and Unstable Nuclei

#### The Strong Nuclear Force (SNF)

The **strong nuclear force (SNF)** keeps nuclei stable by counteracting the electrostatic repulsion between protons. Key characteristics:

- Acts only on nucleons
- Very short range
- **Attractive** at separations up to approximately 3 fm
- **Repulsive** below separations of approximately 0.5 fm

#### Unstable Nuclei

**Unstable nuclei** have too many protons, neutrons, or both, causing the SNF to be insufficient to maintain stability. These nuclei decay to become stable.

#### Alpha Decay (α)

**Alpha decay** occurs in large nuclei with excess protons and neutrons.

$$^{A}_{Z}X \rightarrow ^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y + ^{4}_{2}\alpha$$

- Proton number decreases by 2
- Nucleon number decreases by 4

#### Beta-Minus Decay (β⁻)

**Beta-minus decay** occurs in neutron-rich nuclei.

$$^{A}_{Z}X \rightarrow ^{A}_{Z+1}Y + ^{0}_{-1}\beta + \bar{\nu}_{e}$$

- Proton number increases by 1
- Nucleon number stays the same
- An electron antineutrino ($\bar{\nu}_{e}$) is emitted

**Discovery of the neutrino:** Scientists initially believed only an electron was emitted during beta decay. However, observations showed energy was not conserved, violating the principle of conservation of energy. **Neutrinos** were hypothesised to account for the missing energy and were later experimentally observed.

### 2.1.3 Particles, Antiparticles and Photons

#### Antiparticles

For every particle, there exists an **antiparticle** with:
- Same rest energy and mass
- Opposite values for all other properties (e.g., charge)

| Particle | Mass (kg) | Rest Energy (MeV) | Charge (C) |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Electron ($e^{-}$) | $9.11 \times 10^{-31}$ | 0.511 | $-1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ |
| Positron ($e^{+}$) | $9.11 \times 10^{-31}$ | 0.511 | $+1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ |
| Electron neutrino ($\nu_{e}$) | ≈ 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Electron antineutrino ($\bar{\nu}_{e}$) | ≈ 0 | 0 | 0 |

#### Photons

Electromagnetic radiation travels in discrete packets called **photons**, which transfer energy and have no mass.

**Photon energy:**

$$E = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$

where $h = 6.63 \times 10^{-34}$ J s (Planck constant)

#### Annihilation

**Annihilation** occurs when a particle and its corresponding antiparticle collide:
- Their masses are converted into energy
- Two photons are released moving in opposite directions (to conserve momentum)
- Total energy released = rest energies + kinetic energies of both particles

**Application:** PET scanners use annihilation. A positron-emitting radioisotope is introduced into the patient; emitted positrons annihilate with electrons, producing gamma photons that are detected to create 3D images.

#### Pair Production

**Pair production** is the conversion of a photon into a particle-antiparticle pair.

Requirements:
- Photon energy must be greater than the combined rest energy of both particles
- Excess energy becomes kinetic energy of the particles

**Minimum photon energy for electron-positron pair:**

$$E_{min} = 2 \times 0.511 \text{ MeV} = 1.022 \text{ MeV}$$

### 2.1.4 Particle Interactions

#### Fundamental Forces

There are four fundamental forces:

| Interaction | Exchange Particle | Range (m) | Acts On |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| Strong | Gluon | $3 \times 10^{-15}$ | Hadrons |
| Weak | W boson ($W^{+}$ or $W^{-}$) | $10^{-18}$ | All particles |
| Electromagnetic | Virtual photon ($\gamma$) | Infinite | Charged particles |
| Gravity | Graviton | Infinite | Particles with mass |

#### Exchange Particles

**Exchange particles** carry energy and momentum between interacting particles. Each fundamental force has its own exchange particle(s).

#### Weak Interactions

The weak nuclear force is responsible for:
- Beta decay (β⁺ and β⁻)
- Electron capture
- Electron-proton collisions

**Key Weak Interactions:**

**Electron capture / Electron-proton collision:**
$$p + e^{-} \rightarrow n + \nu_{e}$$

**Beta-plus decay:**
$$p \rightarrow n + e^{+} + \nu_{e}$$

**Beta-minus decay:**
$$n \rightarrow p + e^{-} + \bar{\nu}_{e}$$

*Note: Electron capture uses $W^{+}$ boson; electron-proton collision uses $W^{-}$ boson.*

### 2.1.5 Classification of Particles

All particles are classified as either **hadrons** or **leptons**.

#### Leptons

- **Fundamental particles** (cannot be broken down further)
- Do **not** experience the strong nuclear force
- Examples: electron ($e^{-}$), muon ($\mu^{-}$), electron neutrino ($\nu_{e}$), muon neutrino ($\nu_{\mu}$), and their antiparticles

A **muon** is sometimes called a "heavy electron" and decays into electrons.

#### Hadrons

- Formed of quarks (quarks are fundamental)
- Experience the strong nuclear force

**Types of Hadrons:**

| Type | Composition | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Baryons** | 3 quarks | Proton, neutron |
| **Antibaryons** | 3 antiquarks | Antiproton, antineutron |
| **Mesons** | 1 quark + 1 antiquark | Pion, kaon |

#### Baryon Number (B)

| Particle Type | Baryon Number |
|---------------|---------------|
| Baryon | +1 |
| Antibaryon | -1 |
| Non-baryon | 0 |

**Baryon number is always conserved** in particle interactions.

The **proton** is the only stable baryon; all other baryons eventually decay into protons.

#### Lepton Number (L)

| Particle Type | Lepton Number |
|---------------|---------------|
| Lepton | +1 |
| Antilepton | -1 |
| Non-lepton | 0 |

Two types of lepton number must be tracked:
- **Electron lepton number ($L_e$)**
- **Muon lepton number ($L_\mu$)**

**Lepton number is always conserved** in particle interactions (each type separately).

#### Strange Particles and Strangeness

**Strange particles** are produced by the strong interaction but decay via the weak interaction.

- Kaons are strange particles that decay into pions
- **Strangeness (S)** is conserved in strong interactions
- In weak interactions, strangeness can change by 0, +1, or -1

---

### 2.1.6 Quarks and Antiquarks

Quarks are fundamental particles that combine to form hadrons.

#### Quark Properties

| Quark | Symbol | Charge | Baryon Number | Strangeness |
|-------|--------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Up | u | $+\frac{2}{3}e$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ | 0 |
| Down | d | $-\frac{1}{3}e$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ | 0 |
| Strange | s | $-\frac{1}{3}e$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ | -1 |

*Antiquarks have opposite values for all properties.*

#### Baryon Quark Combinations

| Particle | Quark Combination | Charge |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Proton | uud | +1 |
| Neutron | udd | 0 |
| Antiproton | $\bar{u}\bar{u}\bar{d}$ | -1 |
| Antineutron | $\bar{u}\bar{d}\bar{d}$ | 0 |

#### Meson Quark Combinations

| Particle | Quark Combination | Charge | Strangeness |
|----------|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| $\pi^{0}$ | $u\bar{u}$ or $d\bar{d}$ | 0 | 0 |
| $\pi^{+}$ | $u\bar{d}$ | +1 | 0 |
| $\pi^{-}$ | $\bar{u}d$ | -1 | 0 |
| $K^{0}$ | $d\bar{s}$ or $\bar{d}s$ | 0 | ±1 |
| $K^{+}$ | $u\bar{s}$ | +1 | +1 |
| $K^{-}$ | $\bar{u}s$ | -1 | -1 |

#### Beta Decay at Quark Level

**Beta-minus decay:** A down quark changes to an up quark
$$d \rightarrow u + e^{-} + \bar{\nu}_{e}$$

**Beta-plus decay:** An up quark changes to a down quark
$$u \rightarrow d + e^{+} + \nu_{e}$$

---

### 2.1.7 Applications of Conservation Laws

#### Quantities That Must Always Be Conserved

- Energy and momentum
- Charge
- Baryon number
- Electron lepton number
- Muon lepton number

**Strangeness** is only conserved in strong interactions (not in weak interactions).

#### Verification Method

To verify whether an interaction is possible, check that each conserved quantity has the same total value before and after the interaction.

**Example: Beta-minus decay** ($n \rightarrow p + e^{-} + \bar{\nu}_{e}$)

| Quantity | Before | After | Change |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Charge | 0 | +1 + (-1) + 0 = 0 | 0 ✓ |
| Baryon number | 1 | 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 | 0 ✓ |
| Electron lepton number | 0 | 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 | 0 ✓ |
| Muon lepton number | 0 | 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 | 0 ✓ |

All conservation laws are obeyed, so this interaction is possible.

## 2.2 Electromagnetic Radiation and Quantum Phenomena

### 2.2.1 The Photoelectric Effect

The **photoelectric effect** is the emission of photoelectrons from a metal surface when electromagnetic radiation above a certain frequency is incident upon it.

#### Key Observations

- Photoelectrons are only emitted if the incident light exceeds the **threshold frequency** ($f_0$)
- The threshold frequency varies between different metals
- Increasing light intensity (above threshold) increases the number of photoelectrons emitted per second, not their maximum kinetic energy
- There is no time delay between illumination and emission

#### Why Wave Theory Failed

Wave theory predicted that any frequency of light should eventually cause emission, as energy would accumulate gradually. This contradicted experimental observations.

#### The Photon Model Explanation

- EM waves travel in discrete packets called **photons**
- Photon energy is directly proportional to frequency: $E = hf$
- **Each electron can only absorb one photon**
- A photoelectron is only emitted if the single photon has sufficient energy

#### Work Function

The **work function** ($\phi$) is the minimum energy required for an electron to escape from the metal surface.

#### Stopping Potential

The **stopping potential** ($V_s$) is the potential difference required to stop photoelectrons with maximum kinetic energy.

$$E_{k(max)} = eV_s$$

where $e$ is the electron charge.

#### The Photoelectric Equation

$$E = hf = \phi + E_{k(max)}$$

or equivalently:

$$hf = \phi + \frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^{2}$$

---

### 2.2.2 Collisions of Electrons with Atoms

Electrons in atoms can only exist in **discrete energy levels**.

#### Excitation

**Excitation** occurs when an electron gains energy from a collision with a free electron, causing it to move to a higher energy level. The electron quickly returns to the ground state, releasing energy as a photon.

$$\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = hf$$

#### Ionisation

**Ionisation** occurs when an electron gains enough energy to be completely removed from the atom. This requires energy greater than or equal to the **ionisation energy**.

#### Fluorescent Tubes

Fluorescent tubes demonstrate excitation in practice:

1. A high voltage accelerates free electrons through mercury vapour
2. Electrons collide with mercury atoms, causing ionisation and excitation
3. Excited mercury atoms de-excite, emitting UV photons
4. The phosphorous **fluorescent coating** absorbs UV photons
5. Coating electrons become excited and de-excite, emitting visible light photons

#### The Electron Volt (eV)

An **electron volt** is defined as the energy gained by one electron when accelerated through a potential difference of 1 volt.

$$1 \text{ eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$$

**Conversions:**
- eV to J: multiply by $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$
- J to eV: divide by $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$

---

### 2.2.3 Energy Levels and Photon Emission

#### Line Emission Spectra

Passing light from a fluorescent tube through a diffraction grating produces a **line spectrum** with discrete wavelengths, providing evidence that electrons can only transition between discrete energy levels.

#### Line Absorption Spectra

Passing white light through a cool gas produces a **line absorption spectrum**: a continuous spectrum with dark lines at specific wavelengths. These lines correspond to photon energies matching the exact differences between energy levels in the gas atoms.

#### Energy Level Transitions

The energy of an emitted or absorbed photon equals the difference between two energy levels:

$$\Delta E = E_1 - E_2 = hf$$

---

### 2.2.4 Wave-Particle Duality

#### Evidence for Wave Nature

- Diffraction
- Interference

#### Evidence for Particle Nature

- Photoelectric effect

Both light and matter exhibit wave-particle duality.

#### Electron Diffraction

**Electron diffraction** demonstrates the wave nature of electrons. Only waves can undergo diffraction, so observing diffraction patterns with electrons proves they have wave-like properties.

#### De Broglie Wavelength

De Broglie hypothesised that all particles have an associated wavelength:

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{mv} = \frac{h}{p}$$

where:
- $\lambda$ = de Broglie wavelength (m)
- $h$ = Planck constant ($6.63 \times 10^{-34}$ J s)
- $m$ = mass (kg)
- $v$ = velocity (m s⁻¹)
- $p$ = momentum (kg m s⁻¹)

#### Effect of Momentum on Diffraction

- **Increased momentum** → decreased wavelength → less diffraction → narrower diffraction rings
- **Decreased momentum** → increased wavelength → more diffraction → wider diffraction rings

#### Scientific Validation

Wave-particle duality was not immediately accepted by scientists. Experimental evidence (electron diffraction, photoelectric effect) was gathered, **peer-reviewed**, and eventually validated by the scientific community. Scientific knowledge evolves based on experimental evidence.
