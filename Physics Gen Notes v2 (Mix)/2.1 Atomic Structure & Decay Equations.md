# 2.1 Atomic Structure & Decay Equations

## Atomic Structure

### Basic Structure of the Atom

All matter is made from **atoms**. Atoms are made up of three types of particles:

- **Protons** - positively charged, located in the nucleus
- **Neutrons** - neutral (no charge), located in the nucleus
- **Electrons** - negatively charged, orbit the nucleus

### Particle Properties (SI Units)

| Particle | Charge / C | Mass / kg |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Proton | $+1.60 \times 10^{-19}$ | $1.67(3) \times 10^{-27}$ |
| Neutron | $0$ | $1.67(5) \times 10^{-27}$ |
| Electron | $-1.60 \times 10^{-19}$ | $9.11 \times 10^{-31}$ |

### Relative Properties

| Particle | Relative Charge | Relative Mass |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Proton | +1 | 1 |
| Neutron | 0 | 1 |
| Electron | −1 | 1/2000 (negligible) |

### Neutral Atoms

A stable atom is **neutral** (it has no charge). Since protons and electrons have the same magnitude of charge but opposite signs, a stable atom has an **equal number of protons and electrons** for the overall charge to remain neutral.

## Specific Charge

In physics, **'specific'** refers to the characteristic of a property of a substance per unit mass, length, area, volume, etc.

### Definition

**Specific charge** is defined as:

> **The ratio of the total charge of a particle to its mass**

### Equation

$$\text{specific charge} = \frac{\text{charge}}{\text{mass}} = \frac{Q}{m}$$

- **Units:** coulombs per kilogram (C kg⁻¹)

### Data Sheet Values

- Specific charge of the electron: $(e/m_e) = 1.76 \times 10^{11}$ C kg⁻¹
- Specific charge of the proton: $(e/m_p) = 9.58 \times 10^{7}$ C kg⁻¹

### Calculating Specific Charge

**For an ion:**
- Charge = Total number of electrons added/removed × $(1.60 \times 10^{-19}$ C)
- Mass = Total number of nucleons × $(1.67 \times 10^{-27}$ kg)

**For a nucleus:**
- Charge = Total charge of the protons × $(1.60 \times 10^{-19}$ C)
- Mass = Total number of nucleons × $(1.67 \times 10^{-27}$ kg)

**Note:** The number of nucleons is given by the **mass number** of the ion or nucleus.

> **Exam Tip:** Remember not to mix up the 'atom' and the 'nucleus'. The 'atom' consists of the nucleus and electrons. The 'nucleus' just consists of the protons and neutrons in the middle of the atom, not the electrons.

> **Exam Tip:** If there is a **gain** in electrons, the specific charge will be **negative**. If there is a **loss** of electrons, the specific charge will be **positive**.

## Nucleon & Proton Number

### $^A_Z X$ Notation

A nucleus can be described using **$^A_Z X$ notation**, where:

- **A** (top number) = **Nucleon number** (or mass number) = total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus
- **Z** (bottom number) = **Proton number** (or atomic number) = total number of protons in the nucleus
- **X** = Chemical symbol for the element

> **Exam Tip:** In Chemistry, nucleon number is referred to as mass number and proton number as atomic number. Both are valid. The periodic table is ordered by atomic number.

---

## Isotopes

### Definition

**Isotopes** are defined as:

> **Nuclei that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons**

### Key Points

- Elements are defined by a **fixed** number of protons in their atoms
- Atoms of an element can have **different** numbers of neutrons
- An isotope of an element will have:
  - A **fixed** proton number, Z
  - A **different** nucleon number, A

### Unstable Isotopes

Some isotopes have an imbalance of neutrons and protons which makes them **unstable**. This means they constantly decay and emit radiation to achieve a more stable form. Decay timescales range from nanoseconds to over 100,000 years.

### Isotopic Data

**Isotopic data** is defined as:

> **The relative amounts of different isotopes of an element present within a substance**

The **relative atomic mass** of an element can be calculated using the relative abundance values. The percentage abundance of different isotopes in a sample can be obtained using a **mass spectrometer**.

**Application:** A common use of isotopic data is **carbon dating** of archaeological artefacts. This involves using the ratio of stable carbon-12 to unstable carbon-14. The age of a sample of dead tissue can be determined by comparing this ratio to the ratio in a sample of living tissue.

## Strong Nuclear Force

### The Problem

In a nucleus, there are:
- **Repulsive electrostatic forces** between protons due to their positive charge
- **Attractive gravitational forces** due to the mass of the nucleons

Gravity is the weakest of the fundamental forces, so it has a negligible effect compared to electrostatic repulsion. If these were the only forces acting, the nucleus would not hold together.

### The Solution

There must be an attractive force acting between all nucleons which is stronger than the electrostatic force. This is the **strong nuclear force**.

The strong nuclear force acts between particles called **quarks**. Protons and neutrons are made up of quarks, so the interaction between the quarks in the nucleons keeps them bound within a nucleus.

### Properties of the Strong Nuclear Force

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Range | Very short: 0.5 fm to 3.0 fm |
| Below 0.5 fm | **Highly repulsive** |
| 0.5 to 3.0 fm | **Very attractive** |
| Maximum attraction | At approximately **1.0 fm** (typical nucleon separation) |
| Equilibrium position | Approximately **0.5 fm** (resultant force = 0) |
| Above 3.0 fm | **Zero** (has no effect) |
| Charge dependence | **Independent of charge** (same between p-p, n-n, and p-n) |

### Comparison with Electrostatic Force

- At separations between 0.5 and 3.0 fm, the attraction of the strong force is **far more powerful** than the repulsion of the electrostatic force
- The repulsive electrostatic force has a **much larger range** than the strong nuclear force
- The electrostatic force only becomes significant when proton separation is more than around 2.5 fm
- The equilibrium position for protons (where electrostatic repulsion equals strong attraction) occurs at approximately **0.7 fm**

> **Exam Tip:** The strong nuclear force is also referred to as the **strong interaction**. Remember the key values: range = 0.5 to 3.0 fm, typical nuclear separation ≈ 1.0 fm. After 3 fm, write that the strong force becomes 'zero' or 'has no effect' rather than 'negligible'.

> **Note:** 1 fm (femtometre) = $1 \times 10^{-15}$ m

## Alpha (α) Decay

### Overview

**Alpha decay** is common in large, unstable nuclei with too many nucleons (protons and neutrons). The decay involves a nucleus emitting an **alpha particle** and decaying into a different nucleus.

### Alpha Particle

An alpha particle consists of **2 protons and 2 neutrons** (equivalent to a helium nucleus): $^4_2\alpha$ or $^4_2\text{He}$

### Decay Equation

$$^A_Z X \rightarrow ^{A-4}_{Z-2} Y + ^4_2 \alpha$$

**Example:**
$$^{212}_{84}\text{Po} \rightarrow ^{208}_{82}\text{Pb} + ^4_2\alpha$$

### Changes During Alpha Decay

When an alpha particle is emitted from a nucleus:
- **Proton number decreases by 2**
- **Nucleon number decreases by 4**

> **Exam Tip:** Remember that nucleon number decreases by 4 but the number of **neutrons** only decreases by 2 (since 2 protons are also lost).

---

## Beta-Minus (β⁻) Decay

### Overview

A **beta-minus (β⁻) particle** is a high-energy **electron** emitted from the nucleus.

β⁻ decay is when a **neutron turns into a proton**, emitting an electron and an **anti-electron neutrino** ($\bar{\nu}_e$).

### Decay Equation

$$^A_Z X \rightarrow ^A_{Z+1} Y + ^0_{-1}\beta + ^0_0\bar{\nu}_e$$

**Example:**
$$^{14}_6\text{C} \rightarrow ^{14}_7\text{N} + ^0_{-1}\beta + ^0_0\bar{\nu}_e$$

### Changes During Beta-Minus Decay

When a β⁻ particle is emitted from a nucleus:
- **Proton number increases by 1**
- **Nucleon number remains the same**

---

## Beta-Plus (β⁺) Decay

### Overview

A **beta-plus (β⁺) particle** is a high-energy **positron** (anti-electron) emitted from the nucleus.

β⁺ decay is when a **proton turns into a neutron**, emitting a positron and an **electron neutrino** ($\nu_e$).

### Decay Equation

$$^A_Z X \rightarrow ^A_{Z-1} Y + ^0_{+1}\beta + ^0_0\nu_e$$

**Example:**
$$^6_6\text{C} \rightarrow ^6_5\text{B} + ^0_{+1}\beta + ^0_0\nu_e$$

### Changes During Beta-Plus Decay

When a β⁺ particle is emitted from a nucleus:
- **Proton number decreases by 1**
- **Nucleon number remains the same**

> **Exam Tip:** To remember which particle decays into which: think of beta '**p**lus' as the '**p**roton' that turns into the neutron.

---

## Neutrino Emission

### The Electron Neutrino

An **electron neutrino** is a type of subatomic particle with **no charge** and **negligible mass** which is also emitted from the nucleus.

The **anti-neutrino** is the antiparticle of a neutrino.

| Decay Type | Particle Emitted |
|------------|------------------|
| β⁻ decay | **Electron anti-neutrino** ($\bar{\nu}_e$) |
| β⁺ decay | **Electron neutrino** ($\nu_e$) |

### Evidence for Neutrinos

The existence of the neutrino was hypothesised to account for the **conservation of energy** in beta decay.

**Alpha particles:** When the number of α particles is plotted against kinetic energy, there are clear spikes. This demonstrates that α-particles have **discrete energies** (only certain values).

**Beta particles:** When the number of β particles is plotted against kinetic energy, the graph shows a **continuous curve**. This demonstrates that beta particles have a **continuous range of energies**.

This continuous energy spectrum occurs because the energy released in beta decay is **shared between the beta particles and neutrinos**. This was one of the first clues of the neutrino's existence.

The principle of **conservation of momentum and energy** applies in both alpha and beta emission.

## Antimatter

### Definition

All particles of matter have an **antimatter counterpart**. Antimatter particles are **identical** to their matter counterpart but have an **opposite charge**.

### Matter-Antimatter Pairs

| Matter | Symbol | Charge | Antimatter | Symbol | Charge |
|--------|--------|--------|------------|--------|--------|
| Electron | $e^-$ | −1 | Positron | $e^+$ | +1 |
| Proton | p | +1 | Anti-proton | $\bar{p}$ | −1 |
| Neutron | n | 0 | Anti-neutron | $\bar{n}$ | 0 |
| Neutrino | $\nu$ | 0 | Anti-neutrino | $\bar{\nu}$ | 0 |

### Naming Convention

Apart from electrons, the corresponding antiparticle has:
- The same name with the prefix **'anti-'**
- A **line above** its corresponding matter particle symbol

### Properties of Antiparticles

Corresponding matter and antimatter particles have:
- **Opposite charges**
- The **same mass**
- The **same rest mass-energy**

### Mass and Rest Mass-Energy Values

| Particle/Antiparticle | Mass (kg) | Rest Mass Energy (MeV) |
|-----------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Proton/antiproton | $1.67(3) \times 10^{-27}$ | 938.257 |
| Neutron/antineutron | $1.67(5) \times 10^{-27}$ | 939.551 |
| Electron/positron | $9.11 \times 10^{-31}$ | 0.510999 |
| Neutrino/antineutrino | 0 | 0 |

> **Exam Tip:** The datasheet provides masses in kg and rest-mass energies in MeV for a proton, neutron, electron and neutrino.

## The Photon Model

### Definition

**Photons** are fundamental particles which make up all forms of electromagnetic radiation.

A **photon** is defined as:

> **A massless "packet" or a "quantum" of electromagnetic energy**

This means that energy is not transferred continuously but as **discrete packets** of energy. Each photon carries a specific amount of energy, or "quanta", and transfers it all in one go.

### Calculating Photon Energy

$$E = hf$$

Using the wave equation ($c = f\lambda$):

$$E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$

Where:
- $E$ = energy of the photon (J)
- $h$ = **Planck's constant** = $6.63 \times 10^{-34}$ J s
- $c$ = speed of light = $3.0 \times 10^8$ m s⁻¹
- $f$ = frequency (Hz)
- $\lambda$ = wavelength (m)

### Key Relationships

- The **higher** the frequency of EM radiation, the **higher** the energy of the photon
- The energy of a photon is **inversely proportional** to the wavelength
- A long-wavelength photon has **lower** energy than a shorter-wavelength photon

> **Exam Tip:** Definition for a photon: "discrete quantity / packet / quantum of electromagnetic energy" are all acceptable definitions.

---

## Annihilation

### Definition

When a particle meets its corresponding antiparticle, the two will **annihilate**.

**Annihilation** is defined as:

> **The destruction of a particle-antiparticle pair when they collide and convert their mass into two gamma-ray photons**

### Common Annihilation Pairs

- Proton-antiproton annihilation
- Electron-positron annihilation

### Conservation Laws

- To conserve **momentum**, the two photons will move apart in **opposite directions**
- **Mass and energy** are conserved

### Minimum Photon Energy

The minimum energy of **one** photon after annihilation is the total rest mass energy of **one** of the particles:

$$E_{\text{min}} = hf_{\text{min}} = E$$

Where $E$ is the rest mass energy of one of the particles.

---

## Pair Production

### Definition

**Pair production** is the opposite of annihilation. It is defined as:

> **The creation of a particle-antiparticle pair when a high-energy photon spontaneously converts its energy into mass**

### Requirements

- A single photon must have **enough energy** to create **both** particles
- When a photon with enough energy interacts with a **nucleus**, it can produce an electron-positron pair

### Minimum Photon Energy

The minimum energy required for a photon to undergo pair production is equal to the **total rest mass energy** of the particles produced:

$$E_{\text{min}} = hf_{\text{min}} = 2E$$

Where $E$ is the rest mass energy of one of the particles.

### Conservation Laws

- To conserve **momentum**, the particle and antiparticle move apart in **opposite directions**

> **Exam Tip:** Since Planck's constant is in Joules (J), remember to always convert the rest mass-energy from MeV to J using: $1 \text{ MeV} = 1.60 \times 10^{-13}$ J
