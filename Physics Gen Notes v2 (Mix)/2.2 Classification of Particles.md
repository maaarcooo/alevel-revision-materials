# 2.2 Classification of Particles

---

## Hadrons

**Hadrons** are subatomic particles made up of **quarks**. Because they contain quarks, hadrons can experience the **strong nuclear force**.

There are two classes of hadrons:

| Class | Composition | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Baryons** | 3 quarks | Protons (p), Neutrons (n) |
| **Mesons** | Quark-antiquark pair | Pions (π), Kaons (K) |

**Key point**: Quarks have never been discovered in isolation — they always exist in pairs (mesons) or groups of three (baryons).

All hadrons have **integer (whole number) charges** (e.g., +1e, −1e, 0). This means quarks in a baryon must be either all quarks or all antiquarks — combinations of quarks and antiquarks cannot exist in a baryon.

### Anti-hadrons

| Class | Composition | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Anti-baryons** | 3 antiquarks | Antiprotons ($\bar{p}$), Antineutrons ($\bar{n}$) |
| **Anti-mesons** | Quark-antiquark pair | Anti-pions ($\pi^-$), Anti-kaons ($K^-$) |

For mesons, the antiparticle is formed when the quark becomes the antiquark and vice versa.

## Baryons

### Baryon Number

The **baryon number (B)** is a quantum number representing the number of baryons in an interaction.

| Particle Type | Baryon Number |
|---------------|---------------|
| Baryons | $B = +1$ |
| Anti-baryons | $B = -1$ |
| Non-baryons (mesons, leptons) | $B = 0$ |

**Baryon number is conserved in all interactions.** This conservation law determines whether a particle interaction can occur.

Individual quarks have baryon numbers:
- Up (u), down (d), strange (s) quarks: $B = +\frac{1}{3}$
- Antiquarks ($\bar{u}$, $\bar{d}$, $\bar{s}$): $B = -\frac{1}{3}$

### The Proton as a Baryon

The proton is the **most stable baryon** because it is the **lightest baryon**. All other baryons eventually decay into protons.

Key points:
- The proton has the **longest half-life** of any baryon
- Radioactive decay occurs when heavier particles decay into lighter particles
- A proton decay would violate conservation of baryon number
- The proton is theorised to have a half-life of approximately $10^{32}$ years

**Worked Example — Conservation of Baryon Number in β⁻ Decay:**

$$n \rightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$$

Baryon numbers: $1 = 1 + 0 + 0$ ✓ Conserved

## Mesons

### Pions (π-mesons)

Pions are the **lightest mesons**, making them more stable than other mesons. They were originally discovered in **cosmic rays**.

| Particle | Quark Composition | Relative Charge | Strangeness |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| $\pi^+$ | $u\bar{d}$ | $+\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = +1$ | $S = 0$ |
| $\pi^-$ | $d\bar{u}$ | $-\frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = -1$ | $S = 0$ |
| $\pi^0$ | $u\bar{u}$ or $d\bar{d}$ | $0$ | $S = 0$ |

**Antiparticles:**
- The antiparticle of $\pi^+$ is $\pi^-$ (and vice versa)
- The neutral pion $\pi^0$ is its own antiparticle

Pions contain only **up and down quarks**, so they have **zero strangeness**.

### Pions as Exchange Particles

The **strong nuclear force** keeps protons and neutrons bound together in the nucleus. Fundamental interactions are mediated by **exchange particles**.

- The **pion** is the exchange particle of the strong nuclear force between **baryons (nucleons)**
- Pions **mediate** (bring about) the strong nuclear force
- The pion created is a virtual particle (temporary violation of energy-mass conservation)

**Note**: Gluons bind quarks together (strong interaction), while pions bind nucleons together (strong nuclear force). Collectively, these are referred to as the strong force.

### Kaons (K-mesons)

Kaons contain a **strange quark** paired with either an up or down quark, giving them the property of **strangeness**.

| Particle | Quark Composition | Relative Charge | Strangeness |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| $K^+$ | $u\bar{s}$ | $+\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = +1$ | $S = +1$ |
| $K^-$ | $s\bar{u}$ | $-\frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = -1$ | $S = -1$ |
| $K^0$ | $d\bar{s}$ | $-\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = 0$ | $S = +1$ |
| $\bar{K}^0$ | $s\bar{d}$ | $-\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = 0$ | $S = -1$ |

**Key properties:**
- Kaons are heavy and unstable, normally decaying into **pions**
- They have **unusually long lifetimes** compared to other mesons
- Unlike $\pi^0$, the neutral kaon $K^0$ is **not** its own antiparticle

### Kaon Production and Decay

**Production** — via the **strong interaction** (strangeness conserved):

$$p + p \rightarrow p + p + K^+ + K^-$$

Strangeness: $0 + 0 = 0 + 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0$ ✓

**Decay** — via the **weak interaction** (strangeness not conserved):

$$K^0 \rightarrow \pi^+ + \pi^-$$

Strangeness: $+1 \neq 0 + 0$ (strangeness changes by 1)

---

## Leptons

**Leptons** are **fundamental (elementary) particles** — they are not made up of quarks.

Leptons interact via:
- Weak interaction
- Gravitational interaction
- Electromagnetic interaction (if charged)

Leptons do **not** interact via the **strong nuclear force**.

### Common Leptons

| Particle | Symbol | Charge | Mass |
|----------|--------|--------|------|
| Electron | $e^-$ | $-1e$ | ~0.0005 u |
| Electron neutrino | $\nu_e$ | 0 | ~0 |
| Muon | $\mu^-$ | $-1e$ | ~0.1 u |
| Muon neutrino | $\nu_\mu$ | 0 | ~0 |

The muon is similar to the electron but **heavier** (approximately 200 times the electron mass).

**Neutrinos** are the most abundant leptons in the universe and have **no charge** and **negligible mass**.

**Note**: Although quarks are also fundamental particles, they are not classed as leptons because leptons do not interact with the strong force, while quarks do.

### Lepton Number

The **lepton number (L)** is a quantum number that is **conserved in all interactions**.

| Particle Type | Lepton Number |
|---------------|---------------|
| Leptons ($e^-$, $\mu^-$, $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$) | $L = +1$ |
| Anti-leptons ($e^+$, $\mu^+$, $\bar{\nu}_e$, $\bar{\nu}_\mu$) | $L = -1$ |
| Non-leptons | $L = 0$ |

### Muon Decay

- Muons ($\mu^-$) typically decay into electrons
- Anti-muons ($\mu^+$) typically decay into positrons

Muon decay occurs through the **weak interaction** (indicated by W⁻ boson exchange).

**Muon decay equation:**

$$\mu^- \rightarrow e^- + \bar{\nu}_e + \nu_\mu$$

**Conservation check:**
- Charge: $-1 = -1 + 0 + 0$ ✓
- Electron lepton number ($L_e$): $0 = +1 + (-1) + 0$ ✓
- Muon lepton number ($L_\mu$): $+1 = 0 + 0 + 1$ ✓

## Quarks and Antiquarks

### Properties of Quarks

The three most common flavours of quarks are **up**, **down**, and **strange**.

| Quark | Symbol | Charge | Baryon Number | Strangeness |
|-------|--------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Up | u | $+\frac{2}{3}e$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ | 0 |
| Down | d | $-\frac{1}{3}e$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ | 0 |
| Strange | s | $-\frac{1}{3}e$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ | $-1$ |

### Properties of Antiquarks

Antiquarks have **opposite** charges, baryon numbers, and strangeness compared to their corresponding quarks.

| Antiquark | Symbol | Charge | Baryon Number | Strangeness |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Anti-up | $\bar{u}$ | $-\frac{2}{3}e$ | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | 0 |
| Anti-down | $\bar{d}$ | $+\frac{1}{3}e$ | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | 0 |
| Anti-strange | $\bar{s}$ | $+\frac{1}{3}e$ | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | $+1$ |

### Quark Combinations

**Baryons (3 quarks):**

| Particle | Quark Composition | Charge Calculation |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Proton (p) | uud | $+\frac{2}{3} + \frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = +1$ |
| Neutron (n) | udd | $+\frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = 0$ |

**Mesons (quark-antiquark pairs):**

Pions and kaons compositions are shown in the tables above.

**Exam tip**: Quark combinations for protons, neutrons, pions, and kaons must be memorised. However, you can work out unknown combinations by ensuring the quark charges sum to the particle's total charge.

## Strange Quarks and Strangeness

### Strange Particles

**Strange particles** contain a strange or anti-strange quark (e.g., kaons).

Strange particles always:
- Are **produced** through the **strong interaction**
- **Decay** through the **weak interaction**
- Are produced in quark-antiquark **pairs**

### Strangeness (S)

**Strangeness** is a quantum number, like baryon and lepton number.

| Quark Content | Strangeness |
|---------------|-------------|
| Anti-strange quark ($\bar{s}$) | $S = +1$ |
| Strange quark (s) | $S = -1$ |
| No strange quarks | $S = 0$ |

**Conservation of Strangeness:**
- Strangeness is **conserved** in strong and electromagnetic interactions
- Strangeness is **not conserved** in weak interactions
- In weak interactions, strangeness can change by **0, +1, or −1**

**Worked Example — Proving Weak Interaction:**

The sigma baryon ($\Sigma^+$, quark structure suu) decays:

$$\Sigma^+ \rightarrow \pi^0 + p$$

Strangeness: $-1 \neq 0 + 0$

Since strangeness is not conserved (changes by +1), this decay must occur via the **weak interaction**.

## Collaborative Efforts in Particle Physics

### Particle Accelerators

Particle physics experiments use **particle accelerators** to:
- Produce new particles
- Reveal the inner structure of particles

Particles collide at very high energies (close to the **speed of light**). Accelerators can be **linear** or **circular**.

Circular accelerators require **superconducting magnets** to maintain circular orbits at high speeds.

The scale and cost of these experiments require **international collaboration** for funding and expertise.

### The Large Hadron Collider (LHC)

The **Large Hadron Collider** at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland/France border) is the world's largest and highest-energy particle collider.

**Structure:**
- Two proton beams accelerated in opposite directions
- Four main detectors: **ATLAS**, **CMS**, **ALICE**, **LHCb**
- Approximately 2500 scientists from 110 nationalities

**Key achievements:**
- Both ATLAS and CMS detectors independently confirmed the existence of the **Higgs Boson** (2012)
- This demonstrates the importance of **validation** through repeated experiments

**Research areas:**
- ATLAS/CMS: Fundamental particles, dark matter, extra dimensions
- ALICE: Quark-gluon plasma
- LHCb: Matter-antimatter asymmetry, bottom quark physics

## Exam Tips

1. **Quark charges** are provided on the data sheet — antiquark charges are simply the opposite signs.

2. **Baryon number** of each quark is also provided on the data sheet.

3. To determine if an interaction can occur, check conservation of: charge, baryon number, lepton number, and strangeness (for non-weak interactions).

4. If strangeness is **not conserved**, the interaction must be via the **weak force**.

5. For quark combination questions, verify your answer by summing individual quark charges to match the particle's total charge.
