# 2.3 Conservation Laws & Particle Interactions

## The Four Fundamental Interactions

There are **four fundamental interactions** (or fundamental forces) that exist:

- **Gravity** — the weakest force
- **Electromagnetism**
- **Strong Nuclear** (or Strong Interaction) — the strongest force
- **Weak Nuclear**

### Ranges of the Fundamental Interactions

| Interaction | Range |
|-------------|-------|
| Gravitational | Infinite |
| Electromagnetic | Infinite |
| Weak | Up to $10^{-18}$ m |
| Strong | ~ $10^{-15}$ m |

### Which Particles Are Affected

- The **gravitational interaction** only affects particles with **mass**
- The **electromagnetic interaction** only affects particles with **charge**
- The **weak interaction** affects **all** particles
- The **strong interaction** only affects **hadrons**

---

## Exchange Particles

When two particles interact, there cannot be instantaneous action at a distance. This means one particle needs to "know" that the other is there.

- When two particles exert a force on each other, a **virtual particle** (or **exchange particle**) is created
- Virtual particles only exist for a short amount of time and carry the fundamental force between each particle
- A force can be **attractive** or **repulsive**

Each fundamental interaction is transmitted by its own exchange particle. These are also called **gauge bosons**.

### Table of Exchange Particles

| Fundamental Interaction | Exchange Particle |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Strong | Pion ($\pi^+$, $\pi^-$, $\pi^0$) between nucleons; Gluon between quarks |
| Weak | W-boson ($W^+$, $W^-$) or Z-boson ($Z^0$) |
| Electromagnetic | Photon ($\gamma$) |
| Gravitational | Graviton (theorised, not yet discovered) |

Since gravity is so weak, it only has a noticeable effect on large masses. Therefore, gravity does not play a part in particle interactions.

## The Electromagnetic Force

- The electromagnetic force acts only between **charged particles**
- The exchange particle is the **virtual photon**, $\gamma$

### Properties of the Photon

- It has **no mass**
- It has **no charge**
- It is **its own antiparticle**

Electromagnetic interactions occur whenever two charged particles interact with each other. For example, when two electrons are repelled by each other, a virtual photon is exchanged between them to produce this repulsion.

The electromagnetic force is also responsible for **binding electrons to atoms** due to the attractive force between negative electrons and the positive nucleus.

---

## Hadrons & The Strong Nuclear Force

- **Hadrons** are particles made up of quarks
- Hence they are subject to the **strong interaction**

The exchange particle of the strong interaction is:
- The **pion** (between nucleons)
- The **gluon** (between quarks)

**Leptons cannot interact with the strong force** since they are not made up of quarks.

---

## The Weak Interaction

The weak interaction is responsible for the **radioactive decay** of atoms.

The exchange particle that carries this force is the $W^-$, $W^+$ or $Z^0$ boson. The type of exchange particle depends on the type of interaction.

### Beta Decay

$\beta^-$ and $\beta^+$ decay are examples of the weak interaction in action.

#### Beta-Minus ($\beta^-$) Decay

In $\beta^-$ decay, a **neutron** turns into a **proton** emitting an **electron** and an **anti-electron neutrino**:

$$n \rightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$$

- The $W^-$ boson is the exchange particle in this interaction

#### Beta-Plus ($\beta^+$) Decay

In $\beta^+$ decay, a **proton** turns into a **neutron** emitting a **positron** and an **electron neutrino**:

$$p \rightarrow n + e^+ + \nu_e$$

- The $W^+$ boson is the exchange particle in this interaction

> **Exam Tip:** The sign of the W boson matches that of the beta decay. The $W^-$ boson is exchanged in beta **minus** decay and $W^+$ boson is exchanged in beta **plus** decay.

### Electron Capture & Electron-Proton Collisions

Electrons and protons are attracted to each other via the electromagnetic interaction. However, when they interact with each other, it is the **weak interaction** that facilitates the collision.

Both electron capture and electron-proton collisions have the same decay equation:

$$p + e^- \rightarrow n + \nu_e$$

**Electron capture** is when **an atomic electron is absorbed by a proton in the nucleus**, resulting in the release of a neutron and an electron neutrino.
- This decay is mediated by the $W^+$ boson

**Electron-proton collisions** are similar; when **an electron collides with a proton**, a neutron and an electron neutrino are emitted.
- This decay is mediated by the $W^-$ boson

## Feynman Diagrams

Particle interactions and decays can be represented using **Feynman diagrams**. They are a way of visualising particle equations and the exchange particles involved.

### Rules for Feynman Diagrams

1. The y-axis represents **time** and the x-axis represents **space**
2. A **vertex** is where particles and exchange particles meet — these represent points of interaction (e.g. electromagnetic, weak or strong)
3. Incoming particles come in at the **bottom**, and outgoing particles leave at the **top**
4. Particles are represented by **straight lines** which have **arrows**
5. Each straight line must have an **arrow** with its direction forward in time
6. Exchange particles are represented by **wavy lines** which have no arrows
7. The transfer of exchange particles is from left to right unless indicated by an arrow above the wavy line
8. Hadrons/quarks are present on the **left** and leptons on the **right** — they must never meet at a vertex
9. **Charge, baryon number and lepton number must be conserved** at each vertex
10. Lines must **not** cross over

### Exchange Particles in Feynman Diagrams

- Exchange particles act as a force carrier between particles in an interaction
- In electromagnetic interactions, the exchange particle is a **virtual photon**
- In weak interactions, the exchange particle is the **W boson**
- Exchange particles are represented as **wavy lines**
- Charged exchange particles ($W^+$ and $W^-$) sometimes have an arrow above the wavy line to indicate their direction

### Electromagnetic Interactions

When two electrons approach each other, they experience **repulsion** due to the electromagnetic force. This can be represented on a Feynman diagram showing the exchange of a virtual photon.

### Weak Interaction Feynman Diagrams

**Beta-minus decay:** A neutron decays into a proton and a $W^-$ boson. Then, the $W^-$ boson decays into an electron and anti-electron neutrino.

**Beta-plus decay:** A proton decays into a neutron and a $W^+$ boson. Then, the $W^+$ boson decays into a positron and electron neutrino.

**Electron capture:** The proton acts on the electron. A proton absorbs an electron and decays into a neutron and $W^+$ boson. Then, the interaction between the electron and $W^+$ boson forms an electron neutrino.

**Electron-proton collision:** The electron acts on the proton. An electron collides with a proton and decays into a neutron and $W^-$ boson. Then, the interaction between the electron and $W^-$ boson forms an electron neutrino.

> **Exam Tip:** The most common exam mistakes when asked to draw Feynman diagrams are missing out arrows indicating the direction of charged gauge bosons or particles. Although you are not required to sketch and label the space and time axes, all particles must be labelled accurately.

## Quark Transformation in β Decay

$\beta$ decay occurs because of the weak interaction between quarks.

### Beta-Minus Decay (Quark Composition)

$\beta^-$ decay is when a neutron turns into a proton emitting an electron and anti-electron neutrino.

More specifically, a neutron turns into a proton because a **down quark turns into an up quark**:

$$d \rightarrow u + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$$

The $W^-$ boson 'carries away' the negative charge of the down quark which provides the negative charge for the electron and anti-neutrino.

### Beta-Plus Decay (Quark Composition)

$\beta^+$ decay is when a proton turns into a neutron emitting a positron and an electron neutrino.

More specifically, a proton turns into a neutron because an **up quark turns into a down quark**:

$$u \rightarrow d + e^+ + \nu_e$$

The $W^+$ boson 'carries away' the positive charge of the up quark which provides the positive charge for the positron and neutrino.

## Application of Conservation Laws

All particle interactions must obey a set of conservation laws. These are conservation of:

- **Charge**, $Q$
- **Baryon number**, $B$
- **Lepton Number**, $L$
- **Strangeness**, $S$
- **Energy** (or mass-energy)
- **Momentum**

**Important:** Strangeness does **not** need to be conserved in weak interactions. It can change by either **0**, **+1** or **−1**.

Quantum numbers such as $Q$, $B$, $L$ and $S$ can only take **discrete values** (i.e. 0, +1, −1, ½).

### Checking if an Interaction Can Occur

To know whether a particle interaction can occur, check whether each quantum number is equal on both sides of the equation.

- If even one of them, **apart from strangeness in weak interactions**, is not conserved then the interaction **cannot occur**

### Worked Example: Lambda Particle Decay

**Question:** The lambda nought particle $\Lambda^0$ is made up from the quarks uds. Show whether the following interaction is permitted:

$$\Lambda^0 \rightarrow \pi^- + e^+ + \nu_e$$

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Charge**
$0 = -1 + 1 + 0$ ✓ Charge is conserved

**Step 2: Strangeness**
$\Lambda^0$ has an s quark, so strangeness = −1
$-1 = 0 + 0 + 0$ ✗ Strangeness is not conserved

**Step 3: Baryon number**
$\Lambda^0$ is a baryon (3 quarks), so baryon number = +1
$+1 = 0 + 0 + 0$ ✗ Baryon number is not conserved

**Step 4: Lepton number**
$\Lambda^0$ is a baryon, so lepton number = 0
$0 = 0 + (-1) + 1$ ✓ Lepton number is conserved

**Conclusion:** Since the baryon number is not conserved, this interaction is **not permitted**.

### Worked Example: Proving Charge Conservation in β⁻ Decay

**Question:** Using the quark model of beta decay, prove that charge is conserved in:

$$n \rightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$$

**Solution:**

1. $\beta^-$ decay is when a down quark changes to an up quark (neutron → proton)
2. Quark composition of a neutron is **udd**
3. Charge on LHS: $+\frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = 0$
4. Quark composition of a proton is **uud**
5. Charge of proton quarks: $+\frac{2}{3} + \frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = +1$
6. Electron charge = −1, anti-neutrino charge = 0
7. Charge on RHS: $+1 - 1 + 0 = 0$

Since the charges are equal on both sides, charge **is conserved** in the beta decay equation.

> **Exam Tip:** Quantum numbers for any exotic particles will be given in the question. All the rest can be found on the datasheet or can be deduced using the information provided.
