# 2.4 The Photoelectric Effect

## The Electronvolt

The **electronvolt** is a unit commonly used to express very small energies, as quantum energies tend to be much smaller than 1 Joule.

The electronvolt is derived from the definition of potential difference:

$$V = \frac{E}{Q}$$

Where:
- $V$ = potential difference (V)
- $E$ = energy (J)
- $Q$ = charge (C)

When an electron travels through a potential difference, energy is transferred between two points in a circuit or electric field. If an electron (charge $1.60 \times 10^{-19}$ C) travels through a potential difference of 1 V:

$$E = QV = (1.60 \times 10^{-19}) \times 1 = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$$

**Definition:** The electronvolt is the energy gained by an electron travelling through a potential difference of one volt.

$$1 \text{ eV} = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$$

**Converting between eV and J:**
- eV → J: **multiply** by $1.60 \times 10^{-19}$
- J → eV: **divide** by $1.60 \times 10^{-19}$

### Relation to Kinetic Energy

When a charged particle is accelerated through a potential difference, it gains kinetic energy. If an electron accelerates from rest, an electronvolt is equal to the kinetic energy gained:

$$eV = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

Where:
- $e$ = charge of an electron ($1.60 \times 10^{-19}$ C)
- $V$ = potential difference (V)
- $m$ = mass of the particle (kg)
- $v$ = velocity of the particle (m s⁻¹)

Rearranging gives the speed of the electron:

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m}}$$

## Threshold Frequency

The **photoelectric effect** is the phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from the surface of a metal upon the absorption of electromagnetic radiation.

Electrons removed from a metal in this manner are known as **photoelectrons**.

The photoelectric effect provides important evidence that light behaves as a particle:
- Light is **quantised** or carried in discrete packets
- Each electron can absorb only a single photon
- Only frequencies of light above a **threshold frequency** will emit a photoelectron

### Threshold Frequency & Wavelength

**Threshold frequency** is defined as:

> The minimum frequency of incident electromagnetic radiation required to remove a photoelectron from the surface of a metal

**Threshold wavelength** is defined as:

> The longest wavelength of incident electromagnetic radiation that would remove a photoelectron from the surface of a metal

Frequency and wavelength are related by the wave equation:

$$v = f\lambda$$

Since photons are particles of light, $v = c$ (speed of light).

Threshold frequency and wavelength are properties of a material and vary from metal to metal.

### Threshold Frequencies and Wavelengths for Different Metals

| Metal | Threshold Frequency ($f_0$) / Hz | Threshold Wavelength ($\lambda_0$) / nm |
|-------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Sodium | $4.40 \times 10^{14}$ | 682 |
| Potassium | $5.56 \times 10^{14}$ | 540 |
| Zinc | $1.02 \times 10^{15}$ | 294 |
| Iron | $1.04 \times 10^{15}$ | 289 |
| Copper | $1.13 \times 10^{15}$ | 266 |
| Gold | $1.23 \times 10^{15}$ | 244 |
| Silver | $9.71 \times 10^{15}$ | 30.9 |

## The Work Function

The **work function** $\Phi$, or threshold energy, of a material is defined as:

> The minimum energy required to release a photoelectron from the surface of a metal

Consider electrons in a metal as trapped inside an 'energy well' where the energy between the surface and the top of the well equals the work function $\Phi$.

Key points:
- A single electron absorbs one photon
- An electron can only escape from the surface if it absorbs a photon with energy equal to $\Phi$ or higher
- Different metals have different threshold frequencies and hence different work functions

Using the energy well analogy:
- A **more** tightly bound electron requires **more** energy to reach the top of the well
- A **less** tightly bound electron requires **less** energy to reach the top of the well

**Alkali metals** (sodium, potassium) have threshold frequencies in the **visible light region** because the attractive forces between surface electrons and positive metal ions are relatively weak.

**Transition metals** (zinc, iron) have threshold frequencies in the **ultraviolet region** because the attractive forces between surface electrons and positive metal ions are much stronger.

## Stopping Potential

**Stopping potential** ($V_s$) is defined as:

> The potential difference required to stop photoelectron emission from occurring

### Experimental Setup

- Photons arrive at the metal plate (the **emitter plate**) causing photoelectrons to be emitted
- Electrons cross the gap and are collected at the **collector plate**
- The flow of electrons creates a **photoelectric current**

### Determining Maximum Kinetic Energy

- As the e.m.f. of the variable power supply increases, the emitter plate becomes more **positive**
- The potential difference across the tube **opposes** the motion of electrons
- Electrons with sufficient kinetic energy can overcome this attraction and cross to the collector plate
- At the **stopping potential** $V_s$, no electrons can cross the gap

At this point, the energy needed to cross the gap equals the maximum kinetic energy:

$$V_s = \frac{W}{Q} = \frac{E}{Q} = \frac{E_{k(max)}}{e}$$

Therefore, the **maximum kinetic energy** of the photoelectrons is:

$$E_{k(max)} = eV_s$$

Where:
- $E_{k(max)}$ = maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons (J)
- $e$ = charge on an electron (C)
- $V_s$ = stopping potential (V)

### Intensity and Stopping Potential

Increasing the **intensity** of incident radiation increases:
- The **number of photons** incident on the metal plate
- The number of photoelectrons emitted (the **photoelectric current**)

For a given potential difference, increasing intensity increases the photoelectric current but the stopping potential remains the **same**. This shows that **intensity does not affect the kinetic energy** of the photoelectrons.

The **maximum kinetic energy** depends only on:
- The frequency (or wavelength) of the incident photons
- The work function of the metal

**Important:** If frequency is increased while keeping intensity constant, the photoelectric current will **decrease** because:
- Higher frequency means higher energy per photon
- Constant intensity means constant energy per unit area per unit time
- Therefore, fewer photons are emitted at higher frequencies
- Fewer photons means fewer photoelectrons emitted per second

## The Photoelectric Equation

The energy of a photon is given by:

$$E = hf$$

Photons with frequencies **above** the threshold frequency will have **more** energy than just the work function:
- An amount of energy equal to the **work function** is used to **release** the photoelectron from the metal
- The **remaining** energy is transferred as **kinetic energy** to the photoelectron

The **photoelectric equation**:

$$hf = \Phi + E_{k(max)}$$

Which can also be written as:

$$E = hf = \Phi + \frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2$$

Where:
- $h$ = Planck's constant (J s)
- $f$ = frequency of incident radiation (Hz)
- $\Phi$ = work function of the material (J)
- $\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = E_{k(max)}$ = maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons (J)
- $hf$ = energy of a single photon

This equation demonstrates:
- If incident photons do not have high enough frequency and energy to overcome the work function ($\Phi$), then no electrons will be emitted
- At the threshold frequency $f_0$, photoelectric emission only just occurs: $hf_0 = \Phi$
- $E_{k(max)}$ depends only on the frequency of the incident photon, **not** the intensity of the radiation
- The majority of photoelectrons will have kinetic energies **less than** $E_{k(max)}$

### Graphical Representation of Work Function

The photoelectric equation can be rearranged into a straight line equation:

$$E_{k(max)} = hf - \Phi$$

Comparing with $y = mx + c$, a graph of maximum kinetic energy against frequency gives:

| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| y-intercept | $-\Phi$ (work function) |
| x-intercept | $f_0$ (threshold frequency) |
| Gradient | $h$ (Planck's constant) |

There are no electrons emitted below the threshold frequency $f_0$.

## Maximum Kinetic Energy

### Kinetic Energy & Intensity

The kinetic energy of photoelectrons is **independent of the intensity** of incident radiation because **each electron can only absorb one photon**.

Kinetic energy is only dependent on the **frequency** of the incident radiation.

Intensity is the rate of energy transferred per unit area and is related to the number of photons striking the metal plate. Increasing the number of photons will **not** increase the kinetic energy of photoelectrons; it will increase the **number** of photoelectrons emitted.

### Why is the Kinetic Energy a Maximum?

Each electron acquires the same amount of energy from photons for any given frequency. However, the energy required to remove an electron varies because some electrons are on the surface whilst others are deeper in the metal.

- Photoelectrons with **maximum kinetic energy** are those on the **surface** of the metal (they require less energy to leave)
- Photoelectrons with **lower kinetic energy** are those **deeper** within the metal (some energy is used to approach the surface)

### Photoelectric Current

The **photoelectric current** is a measure of the number of photoelectrons **emitted** per second.

- Photoelectric current = number of electrons emitted × charge on one electron
- **Photoelectric current is proportional to the intensity** of radiation incident on the metal surface
- This is because intensity is proportional to the number of photons striking the metal per second
- Since each photoelectron absorbs a single photon, photoelectric current must be proportional to intensity

### Key Relationships (Graphical Summary)

| Graph | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| Electron kinetic energy vs Light frequency | Linear, starting at $f_0$ |
| Electron kinetic energy vs Light intensity | Horizontal line (for $f > f_0$) |
| Electron current vs Light intensity | Linear, through origin (for $f > f_0$) |

## Exam Tips

1. **Unit conversions:** When using the photoelectric equation, $hf$, $\Phi$, and $E_{k(max)}$ must all have the **same units** (joules). Convert any values given in eV into joules by multiplying by $1.60 \times 10^{-19}$.

2. **Stopping potential:** The stopping voltage holds a negative value, but since we use it to determine maximum kinetic energy, its sign is not important in calculations—just quote its magnitude.

3. **eV conversions:** You do not need to remember the value of 1 eV as this will be given on your datasheet, but you need to be confident in the conversion.

4. **Frequency vs intensity:** If frequency changes while intensity stays constant, the photoelectric current changes. If the number of photons stays constant while frequency changes, the photoelectric current stays constant.
