# 2.5 Energy Levels & Photon Emission

## Collisions of Electrons with Atoms

### Energy Levels

Electrons in an atom occupy certain energy states called **energy levels**. Electrons will occupy the **lowest** possible energy level as this is the most **stable** configuration for the atom.

When an electron **absorbs** or **emits** a photon, it can move between these energy levels, or be removed from the atom completely.

### Excitation

**Excitation** is defined as:

> When an electron absorbs enough energy to move up to a higher energy level

Key points about excitation:
- When an electron moves to a higher energy level, the atom is said to be in an **excited state**
- To **excite** an electron to a higher energy level, it must **absorb** a photon
- Electrons can also move back down to a lower energy level by **de-excitation**
- To **de-excite** an electron to a lower energy level, it must **emit** a photon

### Ionisation

**Ionisation** is defined as:

> When an atom gains or loses an orbital electron and becomes charged

Key points about ionisation:
- When an electron is removed from an atom, the atom becomes **ionised**
- An electron can be removed from any energy level it occupies
- The **ionisation energy** of an atom is the **minimum** energy required to remove an electron from the **ground state** of an atom

## Fluorescent Tubes

Fluorescence occurs when an electron in an atomic orbital **absorbs energy** from an interaction with a **photon** or a collision with another **electron**.

### Construction
Fluorescent tubes are partially evacuated glass tubes filled with low-pressure mercury vapour with a phosphor coating on the glass.

### How Fluorescent Tubes Work

1. A **high voltage** is applied across the tube, causing electrons to flow from the cathode to the anode, producing an electron beam

2. These beam electrons **collide** with the electrons in the mercury atoms, **transferring** **kinetic energy** in the collision

3. The atomic **electrons** in the **mercury** atoms gain enough energy for **ionisation** to occur

4. A high energy state is unstable, so high energy electrons will **de-excite** (move back to their original **ground state**)

5. As they de-excite, the electrons release energy by **emitting photons** in the **UV** range of wavelengths

6. The UV photons then collide with **electrons** in the atoms of the **phosphor** coating and **excite** them into a higher energy level

7. As these phosphor electrons **de-excite**, they do so in stages, **emitting photons** in the **visible light** range of wavelengths

## Energy Levels & Photon Emission

### Line Spectra & Energy Levels

Energy levels can be represented as a series of horizontal lines:
- The line at the bottom with the greatest negative energy represents the **ground state**
- The lines above the ground state with decreasing energies represent **excited states**
- The line at the top (usually 0 eV or infinity ∞) represents the **ionisation energy**

### Hydrogen Atom Energy Levels

| Energy Level (n) | Energy Value |
|------------------|--------------|
| 1 (Ground State) | −13.6 eV |
| 2 | −3.40 eV |
| 3 | −1.51 eV |
| 4 | −0.85 eV |
| 5 | −0.54 eV |
| ∞ (Ionisation) | 0 eV |

A photon is emitted when an electron moves from a higher energy state to a lower energy state. The energy of the emitted photon is equal to the difference in energy between the energy levels in the transition.

### Line Spectra

**Line spectra** occur when excited atoms emit light of certain wavelengths which correspond to different colours.

Key characteristics:
- The emitted light can be observed as a series of **lines** with spaces in between
- These series of lines are called **line or atomic spectra**
- Each element produces a unique set of spectral lines
- No two elements emit the same set of spectral lines; therefore, elements can be identified by their line spectrum
- There are two types of line spectra: **emission spectra** and **absorption spectra**

### Emission Spectra

When an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, this results in the **emission** of a photon.

Key points:
- Each transition corresponds to a different wavelength of light and this corresponds to a line in the spectrum
- The resulting emission spectrum contains a set of discrete wavelengths, represented by coloured lines on a black background
- Each emitted photon has a wavelength associated with a discrete change in energy

The photon energy equation:

$$\Delta E = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$

Where:
- $\Delta E$ = change in energy level (J)
- $h$ = Planck's constant (J s)
- $f$ = frequency of photon (Hz)
- $c$ = the speed of light (m s⁻¹)
- $\lambda$ = wavelength of the photon (m)

**Line spectra** provide **evidence** that electrons in atoms can only transition between **discrete energy levels**.

### Absorption Spectra

An atom can be raised to an excited state by the absorption of a photon.

Key points:
- When white light passes through a **cool, low pressure gas**, it is found that light of certain wavelengths are missing
- This type of spectrum is called an absorption spectrum
- An absorption spectrum consists of a continuous spectrum containing all the colours with dark lines at certain wavelengths
- These dark lines correspond exactly to the differences in energy levels in an atom
- When electrons return to lower levels, the photons are emitted in all directions, rather than in the original direction of the white light (so some wavelengths appear to be missing)
- The wavelengths missing from an absorption spectrum are the same as their corresponding emission spectra of the same element

### Difference in Discrete Energy Levels

The difference between two energy levels is equal to a specific photon energy.

The energy ($hf$) of the photon is given by:

$$\Delta E = hf = E_2 - E_1$$

Where:
- $E_2$ = Energy of the higher level (J)
- $E_1$ = Energy of the lower level (J)
- $h$ = Planck's constant (J s)
- $f$ = Frequency of photon (Hz)

The wavelength of the emitted or absorbed radiation can be related to the energy difference:

$$\lambda = \frac{hc}{E_2 - E_1}$$

**Important relationship**: The larger the difference in energy between two levels ($\Delta E$), the shorter the wavelength $\lambda$, and vice versa.

## Wave-Particle Duality

### The Dual Nature of Light

Light can behave as a particle (i.e. photons) **and** a wave. This phenomenon is called the wave-particle nature of light or **wave-particle duality**.

**Light as a particle:**
- Light interacts with matter, such as electrons, **as a particle**
- The evidence for this is provided by the photoelectric effect

**Light as a wave:**
- Light propagates through space **as a wave**
- The evidence for this comes from the **diffraction** and **interference** of light in Young's Double-Slit Experiment

**Diffraction** occurs when waves pass through a gap or around an obstacle and the waves spread out. When light is passed through a slit with a width of similar size to the wavelength, the wave spreads out forming a diffraction pattern.

### Light as a Particle (Photon Model)

Einstein proposed that light can be described as a quanta of energy that behave as particles, called photons.

The photon model of light explains that:
- Electromagnetic waves carry energy in discrete packets called photons
- The energy of the photons are quantised according to the equation **$E = hf$**
- In the photoelectric effect, each electron can absorb only a single photon — this means only the frequencies of light above the threshold frequency will emit a photoelectron

### Why Wave Theory Fails to Explain the Photoelectric Effect

| Wave Theory Prediction | Why It's Wrong |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Any frequency of light can give rise to photoelectric emission if the exposure time is long enough | Photoelectrons will be released immediately if the frequency is above the threshold for that metal |
| The energy absorbed by each electron will increase gradually with each wave | Energy is absorbed instantaneously — photoelectrons are either emitted or not emitted after exposure to light |
| The kinetic energy of the emitted electrons should increase with radiation intensity | If the intensity of the light is increased, **more photoelectrons are emitted per second** (not higher kinetic energy) |

Although the wave theory provides good explanations for phenomena such as interference and diffraction, it fails to explain the photoelectric effect.

### Electron Diffraction

Louis de Broglie discovered that **matter** can behave as a **wave**.

**Experiments** show that a **diffraction pattern** is produced when a beam of electrons is directed at a thin graphite film. Diffraction is a property of **waves**, and cannot be explained by describing electrons as particles.

Key observations in electron diffraction:
- In order to observe the diffraction of electrons, they must be focused through a gap similar in size to their **de Broglie wavelength**, such as an atomic lattice
- Graphite film is ideal for this purpose because of its crystalline structure
- The gaps between neighbouring planes of the atoms in the crystals act as slits, allowing the electron waves to spread out and create a diffraction pattern
- The diffraction pattern is observed on the screen as a series of concentric rings
- If the electrons acted as particles, a pattern would not be observed; instead, the particles would be distributed uniformly across the screen

**Effect of accelerating voltage:**
- A larger accelerating voltage reduces the diameter of a given ring
- A lower accelerating voltage increases the diameter of the rings

### Investigating Electron Diffraction

Electron diffraction tubes can be used to investigate the wave properties of electrons:
- Electrons are accelerated in an electron gun to a high potential (e.g. 5000 V) and directed through a thin film of graphite
- The electrons diffract from the gaps between carbon atoms and produce a circular pattern on a fluorescent screen made from phosphor

The kinetic energy of the electrons is proportional to the voltage across the anode-cathode:

$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = eV$$

## The de Broglie Wavelength

The de Broglie equation relates **wavelength** (a property of waves) to **momentum** (a property of matter).

### Key Relationships

In the electron diffraction experiment:
- Increasing the **speed** of electrons, and hence their **momentum**, causes the angle of **diffraction** to decrease (as seen by the decrease in the diameter of the diffraction rings)
- This is in agreement with wave theory, where the angle of diffraction decreases as the wavelength decreases
- Therefore, the greater the momentum of the particle, the smaller the de Broglie wavelength

### The de Broglie Equation

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$$

Using momentum $p = mv$, the de Broglie wavelength can be written in terms of the speed of a moving particle:

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$$

### Relating de Broglie Wavelength to Kinetic Energy

Using kinetic energy $E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, momentum and kinetic energy can be related by:

$$E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{mv^2}{2} = \frac{p^2}{2m}$$

Therefore:

$$p = \sqrt{2mE}$$

Combining this with the de Broglie equation gives:

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2mE}}$$

Where:
- $\lambda$ = the de Broglie wavelength (m)
- $h$ = Planck's constant (J s)
- $p$ = momentum of the particle (kg m s⁻¹)
- $E$ = kinetic energy of the particle (J)
- $m$ = mass of the particle (kg)
- $v$ = speed of the particle (m s⁻¹)

## Diffraction Effects of Momentum

When electrons pass through a slit similar in size to their de Broglie wavelength, they exhibit diffraction, a property of waves.

### Applications

- The regular spacing of atoms in a crystalline solid acts as a diffraction grating, scattering the electrons in a predictable manner
- The observed diffraction pattern can be used to deduce the structure of the crystal producing that pattern
- High energy electrons have a **shorter wavelength** and can therefore be used to look at the **size of the nucleus** of an atom (as opposed to the arrangement of atoms in a crystal)

### Effect of Momentum on Wavelength

From de Broglie's equation $\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$:
- A smaller momentum will result in a **longer wavelength**
- A larger momentum will result in a **shorter wavelength**

### Effect of Kinetic Energy on Diffraction

The speed of an electron can be increased by increasing the accelerating voltage (or potential difference).

If the electron speed, and therefore kinetic energy is increased, then:
- The wavelength of the wave will **decrease**
- The diffraction rings will appear **closer** together
- The higher the kinetic energy of the electron, the higher its momentum hence the **shorter** its de Broglie wavelength

### Radius of the Diffraction Pattern

The radius of the diffraction pattern depends on the wavelength:
- The **longer** the wavelength, the more the light spreads out hence a **larger radius** is produced
- The shorter the wavelength, the **smaller the radius** produced

Therefore, electrons with smaller momentum will produce a more diffuse diffraction pattern.

### Diffraction Grating Equation

For electron diffraction through a crystal lattice:

$$d \sin\theta = n\lambda$$

Where:
- $d$ = spacing between atoms (m)
- $\theta$ = angle of diffraction
- $n$ = order of diffraction
- $\lambda$ = de Broglie wavelength (m)

## Analysis of the Nature of Matter

### The Evolving Field of Quantum Mechanics

The field of quantum mechanics is a relatively new field of research, compared to fields in classical mechanics (Newton's laws, wave theory, etc.).

Around 1900, discoveries such as the electron and the gamma photon began to conflict with the existing models scientists held about the nature of matter. Soon after, new theories about the nature of matter began to emerge from **Max Planck**, **Niels Bohr** and **Albert Einstein**, who are seen as the pioneers of **Quantum Theory**.

The understanding of quantum mechanics and the nature of matter has changed over time:
- Scientists use the existing models, such as wave theory, to make predictions
- Sometimes the results of their experiments were not as predicted and did not fit with the existing model, for example, **the photoelectric effect**
- Scientists then have to change the model so that it can explain the new evidence, for example, **wave-particle duality**

### Development of Scientific Theories

When a new theory is suggested, such as de Broglie's idea of particles acting as waves, the theory needs to be **evaluated**.

- Other scientists evaluate the theory in a process called **peer review**
- When enough experimental evidence is found to support the theory, it is **validated**
- De Broglie's theory is currently accepted to be correct until any conflicting evidence is found

### Peer Review

Scientists across the world form a **scientific community**. Scientific claims from new research that is published in journals must be peer-reviewed or evaluated by other scientists who are experts in that field of science.

During the peer review process, scientists must check:

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Validity** | Does the research achieve what it says it does? Is the method appropriate and how have any errors been addressed? |
| **Originality** | Are the results new or has anyone else already carried out similar research? If so, has their work been credited? |
| **Significance** | Are the findings of the research important or ground-breaking? |

### Evaluating Scientific Claims

Claims that are from research that is not peer-reviewed should always be questioned. There could be a multitude of problems, including the method used, the accuracy of results, or the conclusions drawn.

Research should also be checked that it is:
- **Repeatable** by the same scientists who carried it out
- **Reproducible** by other teams of scientists

## Exam Tips

1. When converting between eV and J: multiply by $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ to convert eV → J

2. For energy level transitions, the negative sign can be ignored when calculating the difference between levels — you just need the magnitude of the energy difference

3. Remember: larger energy transitions produce shorter wavelength photons (and vice versa)

4. Particles with greater mass have greater momentum at the same speed, resulting in a smaller de Broglie wavelength

5. It doesn't matter which energy level you assign as $E_1$ or $E_2$; you just need to know the difference between the energy of the two energy levels

6. Always perform a logic check: particles with greater mass should have smaller de Broglie wavelengths at the same kinetic energy
