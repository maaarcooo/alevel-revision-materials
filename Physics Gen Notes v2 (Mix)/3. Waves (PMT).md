# 3. Waves

## 3.1 Progressive and Stationary Waves

### 3.1.1 Progressive Waves

A **progressive wave transfers energy without transferring material** and is made up of particles of a medium (or field) **oscillating**. For example, water waves consist of water particles moving up and down.

**Key Definitions:**

| Term | Definition | Unit |
|------|------------|------|
| **Amplitude** | Maximum displacement from the equilibrium position | m |
| **Frequency, f** | Number of complete oscillations passing through a point per second | Hz |
| **Wavelength, λ** | Length of one whole oscillation (distance between successive peaks/troughs) | m |
| **Speed, c** | Distance travelled by the wave per unit time | m/s |
| **Phase** | Position of a certain point on a wave cycle | radians, degrees, or fractions of a cycle |
| **Phase difference** | How much a particle/wave lags behind another particle/wave | radians, degrees, or fractions of a cycle |
| **Period, T** | Time taken for one full oscillation | s |

**Phase Relationships:**

Two points on a wave are **in phase** if they are at the same point of the wave cycle. They will have the **same displacement and velocity**, and their **phase difference will be a multiple of 360°** (2π radians). Points in phase do not need the same amplitude, only the same frequency and wavelength.

Two points are **completely out of phase** when they are an **odd integer of half cycles apart** (e.g., 5 half cycles apart), where one half cycle is 180° (π radians).

**Wave Equations:**

The **speed** of a wave:
$$c = f\lambda$$

The **frequency** of a wave:
$$f = \frac{1}{T}$$

### 3.1.2 Longitudinal and Transverse Waves

**Transverse waves** - oscillation of particles (or fields) is at **right angles to the direction of energy transfer**.

- All electromagnetic (EM) waves are **transverse** and travel at $3 \times 10^8$ m/s in a vacuum
- Can be demonstrated by shaking a slinky **vertically** or through waves on a string attached to a signal generator

**Longitudinal waves** - oscillation of particles is **parallel to the direction of energy transfer**.

- Made up of **compressions and rarefactions**
- Cannot travel in a vacuum
- Sound is an example of a longitudinal wave
- Can be demonstrated by pushing a slinky **horizontally**

**Polarisation:**

A **polarised wave oscillates in only one plane** (e.g., only up and down). **Only transverse waves can be polarised.**

Polarisation provides **evidence for the nature of transverse waves** because polarisation can only occur if a wave's oscillations are perpendicular to its direction of travel (as they are in transverse waves).

**Applications of Polarisation:**

- **Polaroid sunglasses** - reduce glare by **blocking partially polarised light** reflected from water and tarmac, as they only allow oscillations in the plane of the filter
- **TV and radio signals** - usually plane-polarised by the orientation of the rods on the transmitting aerial, so the receiving aerial must be aligned in the same plane of polarisation to receive the signal at **full strength**

### 3.1.3 Principle of Superposition and Formation of Stationary Waves

**Superposition** is where the **displacements** of two waves are combined as they pass each other. The resultant displacement is the **vector sum** of each wave's displacement.

**Types of Interference:**

- **Constructive interference** - occurs when two waves have displacement in the **same direction**
- **Destructive interference** - occurs when one wave has positive displacement and the other has negative displacement. If the waves have equal but **opposite** displacements, **total destructive interference** occurs

**Stationary Waves:**

A **stationary wave** is formed from the **superposition of 2 progressive waves**, travelling in **opposite directions** in the same plane, with the **same frequency, wavelength and amplitude**.

**No energy is transferred by a stationary wave.**

- Where waves meet **in phase**, constructive interference occurs and **antinodes** are formed (regions of maximum amplitude)
- Where waves meet **completely out of phase**, destructive interference occurs and **nodes** are formed (regions of no displacement)

**Formation Example:**

A string fixed at one end and attached to a driving oscillator at the other demonstrates stationary wave formation. A wave travelling down the string is reflected at the fixed end and travels back, causing superposition. Since the waves have the same wavelength, frequency, and amplitude, a stationary wave forms.

**Harmonics:**

The **first harmonic** is the lowest frequency at which a stationary wave forms, producing two nodes and a single antinode.

The **distance between adjacent nodes (or antinodes) is half a wavelength** for any harmonic.

**First Harmonic Frequency:**
$$f = \frac{1}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$

Where:
- $L$ = length of the vibrating string
- $T$ = tension in the string
- $\mu$ = mass per unit length

For higher harmonics:
- Second harmonic: $2f_1$ (2 antinodes)
- Third harmonic: $3f_1$ (3 antinodes)
- nth harmonic: $nf_1$ (n antinodes)

**Examples of Stationary Waves:**

- **Stationary microwaves** - formed by reflecting a microwave beam at a metal plate; nodes and antinodes found using a **microwave probe**
- **Stationary sound waves** - formed by placing a speaker at one end of a closed glass tube with powder along the bottom. Powder shakes at antinodes and settles at nodes. Since the distance between nodes is λ/2 and the frequency is known, the speed of sound can be calculated using $c = f\lambda$

## 3.2 Refraction, Diffraction and Interference

### 3.2.1 Interference

**Path difference** is the difference in the distance travelled by two waves.

A **coherent** light source has the **same frequency and wavelength** and a **fixed phase difference**.

**Lasers** are coherent and monochromatic (emit a single or small range of wavelengths). Lasers form clear interference patterns and are usually used in diffraction experiments.

**Young's Double Slit Experiment:**

This experiment demonstrates interference of light from two sources.

**Procedure:**
1. Shine a coherent light source through 2 slits about the **same size as the wavelength** of the laser light so the light **diffracts**
2. Each slit acts as a **coherent point source**, creating a pattern of light and dark fringes

**Fringe Formation:**
- **Light fringes (bright)** - formed where light meets **in phase** and interferes constructively; path difference is a **whole number** of wavelengths ($n\lambda$, where n is an integer)
- **Dark fringes** - formed where light meets **completely out of phase** and interferes destructively; path difference is a **whole number and a half** wavelengths $((n + \frac{1}{2})\lambda)$

**Double Slit Equation:**
$$w = \frac{\lambda D}{s}$$

Where:
- $w$ = fringe spacing
- $\lambda$ = wavelength of light
- $D$ = distance between screen and slits
- $s$ = slit separation

**White Light Pattern:**

Using white light instead of monochromatic laser light produces:
- **Wider maxima**
- **Less intense** diffraction pattern
- **Central white fringe**
- Alternating bright fringes which are **spectra** (violet closest to central maximum, red furthest)

**Laser Safety Precautions:**

Lasers can permanently damage eyesight. Safety measures:
- Wear **laser safety goggles**
- **Don't** shine the laser at **reflective surfaces**
- Display a **warning sign**
- Never shine the laser at a person

**Sound Wave Interference:**

Interference can be demonstrated with sound waves using two speakers connected to the same signal generator. Intensity is measured using a microphone to find maxima and minima.

**Historical Significance:**

Young's double slit experiment provided evidence for the **wave nature of light** because **diffraction and interference are wave properties**. This proved that EM radiation must act as a wave (at least some of the time), disproving earlier particle theories. **Knowledge and understanding of any scientific concept changes over time in accordance to the experimental evidence gathered by the scientific community.**

### 3.2.2 Diffraction

**Diffraction** is the **spreading out** of waves when they pass through or around a gap.

**Key Principles:**
- Greatest diffraction occurs when the gap is the **same size** as the wavelength
- When the gap is smaller than the wavelength, most waves are **reflected**
- When the gap is larger, there is **less** noticeable diffraction
- When a wave meets an **obstacle**, diffraction occurs round the edges; the **wider** the obstacle compared to the wavelength, the **less diffraction**

**Single Slit Diffraction:**

**Monochromatic** light diffracted through a single slit forms an interference pattern with:
- A **bright central fringe** (double the width of other fringes)
- Alternating dark and bright fringes on either side
- Bright fringes caused by **constructive interference** (waves meet **in phase**)
- Dark fringes caused by **destructive interference** (waves arrive **completely out of phase**)
- Intensity decreases from the central fringe outward

**White Light Single Slit Pattern:**

- **Central white maximum**
- Alternating bright fringes which are **spectra**
- **Violet** closest to central maximum, **red** furthest away

**Varying the Central Maximum Width:**

- **Increasing slit width** → **decreases** diffraction → central maximum becomes **narrower**, intensity **increases**
- **Increasing wavelength** → **increases** diffraction → central maximum becomes **wider**, intensity **decreases**

**Diffraction Gratings:**

A **diffraction grating** is a slide containing many **equally spaced slits very close together**.

When monochromatic light passes through a diffraction grating, the interference pattern is **sharper and brighter** than with a double slit because many more rays reinforce the pattern. This makes measurements more accurate.

**Order Lines:**
- **Zero order line** - ray passing through the centre
- **First order lines** - either side of zero order
- **Second order lines** - outside the first order lines
- And so on for higher orders

**Diffraction Grating Equation:**
$$d\sin\theta = n\lambda$$

Where:
- $d$ = distance between slits (slit spacing)
- $\theta$ = angle to the normal made by the maximum
- $n$ = order number
- $\lambda$ = wavelength

As $\lambda$ increases (e.g., changing from blue to red light), the distance between orders increases because $\theta$ is larger due to increased diffraction, causing the pattern to spread out.

The maximum value of $\sin\theta$ is 1, so any values of n giving $\sin\theta > 1$ are impossible.

**Derivation of the Diffraction Grating Equation:**

1. For the first order maximum, path difference between adjacent rays is one wavelength
2. Let $\theta$ be the angle between the normal and the ray of light
3. A right-angled triangle forms with sides $d$ and $\lambda$
4. Using trigonometry: $\sin\theta = \frac{\lambda}{d}$, which rearranges to $d\sin\theta = \lambda$ (for first order)
5. For other maxima, path difference is $n\lambda$, giving the general equation: $d\sin\theta = n\lambda$

**Applications of Diffraction Gratings:**

- **Stellar spectroscopy** - splitting light from **stars** using diffraction gratings to obtain **line absorption spectra**, showing which elements are present
- **X-ray crystallography** - X-rays directed at a thin crystal sheet (which acts as a diffraction grating) form a diffraction pattern because X-ray wavelength is similar to gaps between atoms. This pattern can measure **atomic spacing** in materials

### 3.2.3 Refraction at a Plane Surface

**Refractive index (n)** is a property of a material measuring how much it slows down light passing through it:
$$n = \frac{c}{c_s}$$

Where:
- $c$ = speed of light in a vacuum
- $c_s$ = speed of light in the substance

A material with a **higher refractive index** is **more optically dense**.

The refractive index of air is **approximately 1** (light doesn't slow down significantly compared to a vacuum).

**Refraction:**

**Refraction** occurs when a wave enters a different medium, causing it to change direction towards or away from the normal depending on the material's refractive index.

As light crosses the boundary between materials, its **speed changes**, which causes its **direction** to change.

- Light entering a more optically dense medium → slows down → **bends towards the normal**
- Light entering a less optically dense medium → speeds up → **bends away from the normal**

**Snell's Law:**
$$n_1\sin\theta_1 = n_2\sin\theta_2$$

Where:
- $n_1$ = refractive index of material 1
- $n_2$ = refractive index of material 2
- $\theta_1$ = angle of incidence in material 1
- $\theta_2$ = angle of refraction in material 2

**Critical Angle and Total Internal Reflection:**

As the angle of incidence increases, the angle of refraction also increases. When the angle of refraction reaches **exactly 90°** (light refracted along the boundary), the angle of incidence has reached the **critical angle ($\theta_c$)**.

**Critical Angle Formula:**
$$\sin\theta_c = \frac{n_2}{n_1} \quad \text{where } n_1 > n_2$$

**Total internal reflection (TIR)** occurs when:
- The **angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle**
- The **incident refractive index ($n_1$) is greater than the refractive index of the material at the boundary ($n_2$)**

**Optical Fibres:**

Optical fibres are flexible, thin tubes of plastic or glass that carry information as light signals. They use total internal reflection.

**Structure:**
- **Optically dense core** - carries the light signal
- **Cladding** with lower optical density - allows TIR to occur, **protects the core from damage**, and prevents **signal degradation** through **light escaping the core**

**Signal Degradation:**

Signal degradation can be caused by:

**Absorption:**
- Part of the signal's energy is absorbed by the fibre
- Reduces the **amplitude** of the signal
- Can cause loss of information

**Dispersion (causes pulse broadening):**

Pulse broadening is where the received signal is broader than the transmitted signal. Broadened signals can overlap, causing loss of information.

Two types:
1. **Modal dispersion** - caused by light rays entering the fibre at different angles, taking different paths (e.g., some travel straight, others reflect repeatedly), arriving at different times
   - Reduced by **making the core very narrow**

2. **Material dispersion** - caused by using light with different wavelengths, meaning rays travel at different speeds
   - Prevented by using **monochromatic light**

Both absorption and dispersion can be reduced using an **optical fibre repeater**, which regenerates the signal during transmission.
