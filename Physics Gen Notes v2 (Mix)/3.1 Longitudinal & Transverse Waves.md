# 3.1 Longitudinal & Transverse Waves

## Progressive Waves

### Definition

A **progressive wave** is defined as:

> A wave that transfers energy from one point to another without transferring the medium itself.

---

## Properties of a Progressive Wave

| Property | Symbol | Definition | Unit |
|----------|--------|------------|------|
| **Displacement** | $x$ | The distance of a point on the wave from its equilibrium position (vector quantity - can be positive or negative) | m |
| **Amplitude** | $A$ | The maximum displacement of a particle in the wave from its equilibrium position | m |
| **Wavelength** | $\lambda$ | The distance between points on successive oscillations of the wave that are in phase | m |
| **Period** | $T$ | The time taken for one complete oscillation or cycle of the wave | s |
| **Frequency** | $f$ | The number of complete oscillations per unit time | Hz (or s⁻¹) |
| **Speed** | $v$ | The distance travelled by the wave per unit time | m s⁻¹ |

---

## Key Equations

### Frequency-Period Relationship

$$f = \frac{1}{T}$$

### The Wave Equation

$$v = f\lambda$$

Where:
- $v$ = wave speed (m s⁻¹)
- $f$ = frequency (Hz)
- $\lambda$ = wavelength (m)

This equation applies to **both transverse and longitudinal waves**.

For a wave of constant speed:
- As wavelength **increases**, frequency **decreases**
- As wavelength **decreases**, frequency **increases**

## Phase Difference

**Phase difference** is a measure of **how much a point or a wave is in front or behind another**.

Phase difference can be determined from the relative position of crests or troughs of two waves of the same frequency:

| Condition | Phase Difference |
|-----------|------------------|
| **In phase** (crests/troughs aligned) | 0° or 360° (0 or 2π radians) |
| **In antiphase** (crest aligns with trough) | 180° (π radians) |

### Converting Phase Difference

| Fraction of λ | Degrees | Radians |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| $\frac{1}{4}\lambda$ | 90° | $\frac{\pi}{2}$ |
| $\frac{1}{2}\lambda$ | 180° | $\pi$ |
| $\frac{3}{4}\lambda$ | 270° | $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ |
| $1\lambda$ | 360° | $2\pi$ |

Phase difference can be calculated from:
- Two different points on the **same wave**
- The same point on **two different waves**

## Transverse Waves

### Definition

A **transverse wave** is defined as:

> A wave in which the particles oscillate **perpendicular** to the direction of the wave travel (and energy transfer).

### Characteristics
- Show areas of **crests** (peaks) and **troughs**
- **Can** be polarised
- Can be demonstrated using a **rope**

### Examples of Transverse Waves
- Electromagnetic waves (radio, visible light, UV, etc.)
- Vibrations on a guitar string
- Waves on a string
- Seismic S-waves (secondary waves)
- Water surface waves

---

## Longitudinal Waves

### Definition

A **longitudinal wave** is defined as:

> A wave in which the particles oscillate **parallel** to the direction of the wave travel (and energy transfer).

### Characteristics
- Show areas of **compressions** and **rarefactions**
  - **Compressions**: regions of **increased** pressure
  - **Rarefactions**: regions of **decreased** pressure
- **Cannot** be polarised
- Can be demonstrated using a **slinky spring**
- Wavelength = distance between two compressions or two rarefactions

### Energy Transfer in Longitudinal Waves
1. Particles in the medium vibrate as they receive energy
2. Compressions cause nearby particles to vibrate with more energy
3. This produces a compression further along in the medium

### Examples of Longitudinal Waves
- Sound waves
- Ultrasound waves
- Waves through a slinky coil
- Seismic P-waves (primary waves)

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Transverse Waves | Longitudinal Waves |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Oscillation direction | Perpendicular to wave travel | Parallel to wave travel |
| Features | Crests and troughs | Compressions and rarefactions |
| Can be polarised? | Yes | No |
| Demonstration | Rope | Slinky spring |
| Examples | EM waves, S-waves | Sound, P-waves |

## Polarisation

### Definition

**Polarisation** is when:

> Particle oscillations occur in a **single plane** perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.

### Key Points

- Polarisation can **only** occur in **transverse waves**
  - Transverse waves oscillate in **any plane** perpendicular to the propagation direction
- **Longitudinal waves cannot be polarised** because they oscillate parallel to the direction of travel

When transverse waves are polarised:
- Vibrations are restricted to **one** direction
- These vibrations remain **perpendicular** to the direction of propagation/energy transfer

### Polarising Filters

Waves can be polarised through a **polariser** or **polarising filter**, which only allows oscillations in a certain plane to be transmitted.

Light can also be polarised through:
- Reflection
- Refraction
- Scattering

## Two Polarisers Experiment

### Parallel Transmission Axes
When two polarising filters have their transmission axes **parallel**:
- Filter A polarises light in a certain axis
- All polarised light passes through filter B unaffected
- **Maximum** intensity of light is transmitted

### Perpendicular Transmission Axes
When two polarising filters have their transmission axes **perpendicular** (90° apart):
- Filter A polarises light in a certain axis
- **None** of the polarised light passes through filter B
- **Minimum** (zero) intensity of light is transmitted

### Intensity Variation with Angle
As the second polariser is rotated through 360°:
- Intensity varies periodically
- Maximum intensity at 0°, 180°, 360° (axes parallel)
- Zero intensity at 90°, 270° (axes perpendicular)

## Applications of Polarisers

### Polaroid Sunglasses
- Contain polarising filters with **vertically oriented** transmission axes
- Block **horizontally polarised light**
- Light reflected from horizontal surfaces (water, wet roads) undergoes **partial plane polarisation** in the horizontal plane
- Polaroid sunglasses reduce glare from reflective surfaces
- Objects underwater can be viewed more clearly

### Polaroid Photography
- Work the same way as Polaroid sunglasses
- Useful for capturing intensified colour and reducing glare
- Enable photography of underwater objects:
  - Glare (horizontally polarised reflected light) is eliminated
  - Light from underwater objects is **refracted**, not reflected, so is **not** plane-polarised
  - Underwater objects appear more brightly in photos

### Radio and Microwave Signals
- Radio and television services are broadcast either **horizontally-polarised** or **vertically-polarised**
- Reception aerials must be mounted in the correct orientation:
  - Flat (horizontal) for horizontally polarised signals
  - On its side (vertical) for vertically polarised signals
- Orientation depends on the transmitter and polarity of broadcast services

| Phase (degrees) = Fraction of $\lambda$ × 360° | Phase difference conversion |
| Phase (radians) = Fraction of $\lambda$ × 2π | Phase difference conversion |

## Examiner Tips

1. **Wave equation notation**: The wave equation may be written as $c = f\lambda$ where $c$ is wave speed. However, $c$ is often reserved for the speed of light ($3 \times 10^8$ m s⁻¹). Use $v$ for any speed that isn't the speed of light.

2. **Labelling diagrams**: When labelling wavelength and time period, ensure arrows go from the very top of one wave to the very top of the next. For amplitude, measure from equilibrium to maximum displacement, not from trough to crest.

3. **Definitions**: The definitions of transverse and longitudinal waves are frequently examined - memorise them precisely.

4. **Intensity graphs**: You may need to describe or draw the graph of intensity vs angle for two polarisers, but calculations using Malus's Law are not required at A-level.
