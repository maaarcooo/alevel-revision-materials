# 3.2 Stationary Waves

## Stationary Waves

**Stationary waves** (also called standing waves) are produced by the **superposition of two waves of the same frequency and amplitude travelling in opposite directions**.

This is usually achieved by a travelling wave and its **reflection**.

Key characteristics:
- The superposition produces a wave pattern where the **peaks and troughs do not move**
- Stationary waves **store energy**, unlike progressive waves which **transfer energy**

## Comparing Progressive and Stationary Waves

| Property | Progressive Waves | Stationary Waves |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Amplitude** | All points have the same amplitude (in turn) | Each point has a different amplitude depending on the amount of superposition |
| **Phase** | Points exactly a wavelength apart are in phase. The phase of points within one wavelength can be between 0° to 360° | Points between nodes are in phase. Points on either side of a node are out of phase |
| **Energy** | Energy is transferred along the wave | Energy is stored, not transferred |
| **Nodes/Antinodes** | Does not have nodes or antinodes | Has nodes and antinodes |
| **Wave Speed** | The wave speed is the speed at which the wave moves through a medium | Each point on the wave oscillates at a different speed. The overall wave does not move |

## Nodes and Antinodes

A stationary wave is made up of **nodes** and **antinodes**:

- **Nodes** are regions where there is **no vibration** (zero displacement)
- **Antinodes** are regions where the vibrations are at their **maximum amplitude**

Important properties:
- The nodes and antinodes **do not move** along the string
- Nodes are **fixed** and antinodes only move in the **vertical direction**

### Phase Relationships

The phase difference between two points on a stationary wave are either **in phase** or **out of phase**:

- Points **between nodes** are **in phase** with each other
- Points that have an **odd number of nodes** between them are **out of phase**
- Points that have an **even number of nodes** between them are **in phase**

### Relationship Between Length and Wavelength

For a stationary wave on a string of length $L$:
- One wavelength $\lambda$ is only a portion of the length of the string
- The distance between adjacent nodes (or adjacent antinodes) is $\frac{\lambda}{2}$

## Formation of Stationary Waves

### The Principle of Superposition

> **When two or more waves with the same frequency arrive at a point, the resultant displacement is the sum of the displacements of each wave.**

This principle describes how waves that meet at a point in space interact.

When two waves with the same frequency and amplitude arrive at a point, they superpose either:

1. **In phase**, causing **constructive interference**
   - The peaks and troughs line up on both waves
   - The resultant wave has **double the amplitude**

2. **In anti-phase**, causing **destructive interference**
   - The peaks on one wave line up with the troughs of the other
   - The resultant wave has **no amplitude**

The principle of superposition applies to **all types of waves** (transverse and longitudinal, progressive and stationary).

### Conditions for Formation

A stationary wave is formed when:

> **Two waves travelling in opposite directions along the same line with the same frequency superpose.**

The waves must have:
- The **same wavelength**
- A **similar amplitude**

At the **nodes**:
- The waves are in **anti-phase** meaning destructive interference occurs
- This causes the two waves to cancel each other out

At the **antinodes**:
- The waves are **in phase** meaning constructive interference occurs
- This causes the waves to add together

Each point on the stationary wave has a **different** amplitude (unlike a progressive wave where each point has the **same** amplitude).

## Examples of Stationary Waves

### Stretched Strings

- Vibrations caused by stationary waves on a stretched string produce **sound**
- This is how stringed instruments (guitars, violins) work
- At specific frequencies, known as **resonant frequencies**, a whole number of half wavelengths will fit on the length of the string

### Microwaves

- A microwave source is placed in line with a reflecting plate and a small detector between the two
- The reflector can be moved to vary the stationary wave pattern formed
- By moving the detector, it can pick up the minima (nodes) and maxima (antinodes)

### Sound Waves

- Sound waves can be produced as a result of the formation of stationary waves inside an **air column**
- This is how musical instruments such as clarinets and organs work
- At certain frequencies, fine powder placed inside the tube forms evenly spaced heaps at the nodes
- To produce a stationary wave in a closed tube, there must be a **node** at the closed end and an **antinode** at the open end

---

## Harmonics

Stationary waves can have different wave patterns, known as **harmonics**.

These depend on:
- The **frequency** of the vibration
- The **situation** in which they are created

As the frequency is increased, more harmonics begin to appear.

### Harmonics on a String (Fixed at Both Ends)

When a stationary wave is fixed at both ends, the simplest wave pattern is a single loop made up of two nodes and an antinode. This is called the **first harmonic** or **fundamental frequency**.

The particular frequencies (resonant frequencies) of stationary waves formed depend on:
- The **length of the string** $L$
- The **wave speed** $v$

#### First Harmonic

- Contains **2 nodes** and **1 antinode**
- Wavelength: $\lambda = 2L$
- Frequency: 

$$f_1 = \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{v}{2L}$$

#### Second Harmonic

- Contains **3 nodes** and **2 antinodes**
- Wavelength: $\lambda = L$
- Frequency:

$$f_2 = \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{v}{L} = 2f_1$$

#### Third Harmonic

- Contains **4 nodes** and **3 antinodes**
- Wavelength: $\lambda = \frac{2L}{3}$
- Frequency:

$$f_3 = \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{3v}{2L} = 3f_1$$

#### General Pattern for the nth Harmonic

- The **nth harmonic** has **n antinodes** and **n + 1 nodes**
- Frequency of the nth harmonic:

$$f_n = n \times f_1$$

---

## Frequency of the First Harmonic

The speed of a wave travelling along a string with two fixed ends is given by:

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$

Where:
- $T$ = tension in the string (N)
- $\mu$ = mass per unit length of the string (kg m⁻¹)

For the first harmonic, $\lambda = 2L$, so using $v = f\lambda$:

$$v = f \times 2L$$

Combining these equations gives the **frequency of the first harmonic**:

$$f = \frac{1}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$

Where:
- $f$ = frequency (Hz)
- $L$ = the length of the string (m)

---

## Required Practical: Investigating Stationary Waves

### Aims of the Experiment

To measure how the frequency of the first harmonic is affected by changing one of the following variables:
- The **length** of the string
- The **tension** in the string
- Strings with different values of **mass per unit length**

### Variables

| Variable Type | Details |
|--------------|---------|
| **Independent variable** | Either length, tension, or mass per unit length |
| **Dependent variable** | Frequency of the first harmonic |
| **Control variables** | If length is varied: same masses (tension), same string (μ) |
| | If tension is varied: same length, same string (μ) |
| | If mass per unit length is varied: same masses (tension), same length |

### Equipment

| Apparatus | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Signal generator | To operate the vibration generator and measure frequency of the first harmonic |
| Vibration generator | Connected to the signal generator to produce the stationary wave |
| Retort stand | To provide a stable fixed end on the table |
| G clamp or 2 kg mass | To place on the retort stand to stabilise apparatus |
| 2.0 m of string | Used to observe the stationary wave |
| Pulley | To allow the masses to hang vertically with less friction |
| Wooden bridge | To provide the other fixed end which can vary the length of the string |
| Mass hanger + 100 g masses | To hang from the pulley to vary the tension in the string |
| Metre ruler | To measure the length of the string |
| Top-pan balance | To measure the mass of the string |

**Resolution of measuring equipment:**
- Metre ruler = 1 mm
- Signal generator ~ 10 nHz
- Top-pan balance = 0.005 g

### Method

1. Set up the apparatus by attaching one end of the string to the vibration generator and pass the other end over the bench pulley and attach the mass hanger
2. Adjust the position of the bridge so that the length $L$ is measured from the vibration generator to the bridge using a metre ruler
3. Turn on the signal generator to set the string oscillating
4. Increase the frequency of the vibration generator until the first harmonic is observed and read the frequency that this occurs at
5. Repeat the procedure with different lengths
6. Repeat the frequency readings at least two more times and take the average of these measurements
7. Measure the tension in the string using $T = mg$ where $m$ is the amount of mass attached and $g = 9.81$ N kg⁻¹
8. Measure the mass per unit length of the string: $\mu = \frac{\text{mass of string}}{\text{length of string}}$

### Analysing the Results

For the first harmonic, wavelength $\lambda = 2L$

So the speed of the stationary wave is:
$$v = f\lambda = f \times 2L$$

Rearranging for frequency:
$$f = \frac{v}{2L} = \frac{v}{2}\left(\frac{1}{L}\right)$$

Comparing this to the equation of a straight line $y = mx$:
- $y = f$ (Hz)
- $x = \frac{1}{L}$ (m⁻¹)
- Gradient $= \frac{v}{2}$ (m s⁻¹)

**Analysis procedure:**
1. Plot a graph of the mean values of $f$ against $\frac{1}{L}$
2. Draw a line of best fit and calculate the gradient
3. Work out the wave speed: $v = 2 \times \text{gradient}$

**Verify** the wave speed using:
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$

### Evaluating the Experiment

**Systematic errors:**
- An oscilloscope can be used to verify the signal generator's readings
- The signal generator should be left for about 20 minutes to stabilise
- Measurements would have greater resolution if the length used is as large as possible
- Measurements should span a suitable range (e.g., 20 cm intervals over at least 1.0 m)

**Random errors:**
- The sharpness of resonance leads to the biggest problem in deciding when the first harmonic is achieved
- This can be resolved by adjusting the frequency while looking closely at a **node** to gain the largest response
- Looking at the amplitude is likely to be less reliable since the wave will be moving very fast

**Procedure for repeat measurements:**
1. Determine the frequency of the first harmonic when the largest vibration is observed
2. Increase the frequency and then gradually reduce it until the first harmonic is observed again
3. Repeat this procedure for three readings
4. Average the three readings and move onto the next measurement

### Safety Considerations

- Use a **rubber string** instead of a metal wire, in case it snaps under tension
- If using a metal wire, **wear goggles** to protect the eyes in case it snaps
- Stand well away from the masses in case they fall onto the floor
- Place a **crash mat** or any soft surface under the masses to break their fall

## Exam Tips

- **Node** = A point of no vibration
- **Antinode** = A point of maximum amplitude
- In exam questions, the lengths of the strings will only be in **whole or half wavelengths**
- A wavelength could be made up of 3 nodes and 2 antinodes OR 2 nodes and 3 antinodes
- Make sure to match the correct wavelength with the harmonic asked for in the question
- Always refer back to the experiment or scenario in an exam question (e.g., the wave produced by a loudspeaker reflects at the end of a tube, creating a stationary wave)
