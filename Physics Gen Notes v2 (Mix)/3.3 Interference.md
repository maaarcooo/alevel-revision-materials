# 3.3 Interference

## Superposition and Interference

When two or more waves arrive at the same point and overlap, their amplitudes combine. This is called **superposition**.

**The principle of superposition** states that:

> When two or more waves overlap at a point, the displacement at that point is equal to the sum of the displacements of the individual waves.

**Interference** is the effect of superposition. Individual wave displacements may be positive or negative and are combined in the same way as other **vector** quantities.

### Types of Interference

| Type | Condition | Result |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Constructive interference** | Waves are in **phase** | Resultant amplitude is larger (peaks align with peaks) |
| **Destructive interference** | Waves are in **antiphase** | Waves cancel each other out (peaks align with troughs) |

At points where waves are neither in phase nor antiphase, the resultant amplitude is somewhere between the two extremes.

## Coherence

For waves to produce a stable interference pattern with constructive and destructive interference, they must be **coherent**.

**Coherence** occurs when waves have:
- The same **frequency**
- A **constant phase difference**

Non-coherent waves have abrupt changes in phase, creating an inconsistent phase difference and no stable interference pattern.

**Examples of coherent light sources:**
- Monochromatic **laser** light
- Sound waves from two nearby **speakers** emitting sound of the same frequency

---

## Path Difference

**Path difference** is defined as:

> The difference in distance travelled by the two waves from their sources to the point where they meet.

### Path Difference vs Phase Difference

| Path Difference | Phase Difference |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Compares the amount of **progress** made by waves along a **path** | Compares the distance between the **phases** (peaks and troughs) of coherent waves travelling parallel to each other at a point |

The path difference between two coherent waves determines whether there is constructive or destructive interference where they meet.

Path difference is generally expressed in multiples of wavelength. To count wavelengths, remember that a **whole number** of wavelengths means the wave should go up, down, and back to where it started.

---

## Conditions for Constructive and Destructive Interference

For waves emitted by two coherent sources:

### Constructive Interference

$$\text{path difference} = n\lambda$$

where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3...$ (any integer)

### Destructive Interference

$$\text{path difference} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\lambda$$

where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3...$ (any integer)

**Key values:**
- Constructive: $0, \lambda, 2\lambda, 3\lambda...$
- Destructive: $\frac{\lambda}{2}, \frac{3\lambda}{2}, \frac{5\lambda}{2}...$

---

## Wavefront Diagrams

Wave behaviour can be shown using a **wavefront diagram**, where a curved line represents each wavefront (peak or trough).

**Interpreting wavefront diagrams:**
- Where **peak meets peak** → constructive interference
- Where **trough meets trough** → constructive interference
- Where **peak meets trough** → destructive interference

Lines of **maximum displacement** show where constructive interference occurs continuously.

## Interference and Diffraction of a Laser

Lasers are ideal for analysing diffraction and intensity patterns because they produce light that is:
- **Coherent** (constant phase difference and frequency)
- **Monochromatic** (same wavelength)

The diffraction pattern produced by a laser on a screen consists of:
- Areas of **constructive interference** → **bright** strips or **fringes**
- Areas of **destructive interference** → **dark fringes**

Other light sources (e.g., filament bulbs, sodium lamps) are **non-coherent** and produce **white light**.

### Safety Issues with Lasers

Lasers produce a very **high-energy beam of light** that can cause **permanent eye damage** or blindness.

**Precautions:**
- **Never** look directly at a laser or its reflection
- Don't shine the laser towards a person
- Don't allow laser beams to **reflect** from shiny surfaces into anyone's eyes
- Wear laser safety **goggles**
- Place a '**laser on**' warning light outside the room
- Stand **behind** the laser

## Demonstrating Interference with Sound and Microwaves

### Using Sound Waves

Two-source interference can be demonstrated with two speakers emitting **coherent sound**.

Sound waves are longitudinal waves made up of **compressions** and **rarefactions**:
- **Constructive interference**: compressions and rarefactions from each wave **line up** → sound appears **louder**
- **Destructive interference**: compression meets rarefaction → waves cancel → **zero sound** is heard

This is the technology used in **noise-cancelling headphones**.

### Using Microwaves

Two-source interference for microwaves can be detected with a moveable microwave detector:
- **Maximum amplitude** or intensity → regions of **constructive interference**
- **Minimum** or zero amplitude → regions of **destructive interference**

---

## Intensity Variation with Amplitude

The intensity of a wave (power per unit area) is proportional to the **energy transferred** by the wave.

The energy transferred by a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude.

Therefore:

$$I \propto A^2$$

where:
- $I$ = intensity of the wave (W m⁻²)
- $A$ = amplitude of the wave (m)

## Young's Double-Slit Experiment

Young's double-slit experiment produces both a diffraction and an interference pattern using:
- The interference of two **coherent** wave sources, or
- A single wave source passing through a **double slit**

### Experimental Setup

1. Laser light source placed behind a **single slit**
2. Light is diffracted, producing two coherent sources at slits A and B
3. Light from the double slits is then diffracted
4. A **diffraction pattern** of bright and dark fringes appears on a distant screen

### The Interference Pattern

- **Constructive interference** → **bright** strips (**fringes**, interference fringes, or **maxima**)
- **Destructive interference** → dark strips (dark **fringes** or **minima**)

Each bright fringe is **identical** with the same width and intensity. The fringes are separated by dark **narrow** bands.

- The **maxima** are formed by **constructive interference** of light
- The **minima** are formed by **destructive interference** of light

### Understanding the Pattern

The wave from slit S₂ travels slightly further than from S₁ to reach the same point. This extra distance is the **path difference**.

For the maxima in the interference pattern:
- $n$ is the **order** of the maxima/minima (position from central maximum)
- $n = 0$ is the **central maximum**
- $n = 1$ represents the first maximum on either side, $n = 2$ the next, etc.

---

## Fringe Spacing Equation

The spacing between bright or dark fringes can be calculated using the **double slit equation**:

$$w = \frac{\lambda D}{s}$$

where:
- $w$ = distance between each fringe (m)
- $\lambda$ = wavelength of the laser light (m)
- $D$ = distance between the slit and the screen (m)
- $s$ = slit separation (m)

### Effect of Variables

The fringe separation $w$ will **increase** if:
- The **wavelength** $\lambda$ of the incident light **increases**
- The **distance** $D$ between the screen and slits **increases**
- The **separation** $s$ between the slits **decreases**

---

## White Light Interference Pattern

When white light is diffracted through a double slit:

- The **central maximum** is **white** (all wavelengths interfere constructively here)
- Two dark narrow destructive interference fringes appear on either side
- All other maxima are composed of a **spectrum**
- **Shortest wavelength** (violet/blue) appears **nearest** to the central maximum (diffracted **least**)
- **Longest wavelength** (red) appears **furthest** from the central maximum (diffracted **most**)
- Colours appear blurry; further from centre, fringe spacing decreases until spectra merge

### Young's Double-Slit Experiment

**Aim:** Investigate the relationship between slit-screen distance $D$ and fringe width $w$.

**Variables:**
- Independent: Distance between slits and screen, $D$
- Dependent: Fringe width, $w$
- Control: Wavelength $\lambda$, slit separation $s$

**Method:**
1. Set up apparatus with $D = 0.5$ m
2. Darken room and turn on laser
3. Measure from central fringe across many fringes; divide by number of fringe widths to find $w$
4. Increase $D$ by 0.1 m increments up to ~1.5 m
5. Repeat three times and calculate mean $w$ for each $D$

**Analysis:**

Comparing $w = \frac{\lambda D}{s}$ to $y = mx$:
- $y = w$
- $x = D$
- Gradient $= \frac{\lambda}{s}$

Plot $w$ against $D$. The wavelength is:

$$\lambda = s \times \text{gradient}$$

### Diffraction Grating Experiment

**Aim:** Calculate the wavelength of laser light using a diffraction grating.

**Variables:**
- Independent: Distance between maxima, $h$
- Dependent: Angle between normal and each order, $\theta_n$
- Control: Distance $D$, wavelength $\lambda$, slit separation $d$

**Method:**
1. Place laser and diffraction grating on retort stands
2. Use set square to ensure beam passes through at normal incidence
3. Set $D = 1.0$ m
4. Darken room and turn on laser
5. Identify zero-order maximum (central beam)
6. Measure distance $h$ to first-order maxima on both sides; calculate mean
7. Repeat for increasing orders
8. Repeat with different gratings

**Analysis:**

The diffraction grating equation:

$$n\lambda = d \sin\theta$$

where:
- $n$ = order of diffraction pattern
- $\lambda$ = wavelength (m)
- $d$ = distance between slits (m)
- $\theta$ = angle between normal and maxima

The slit spacing is:

$$d = \frac{1}{N}$$

where $N$ = number of slits per metre (m⁻¹)

Calculate angle using:

$$\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{h}{D}\right)$$

Calculate mean $\theta$ for each order, then mean wavelength. Compare with accepted value (typically 635 nm for red laser).

### Evaluating the Experiments

**Systematic Errors:**
- Use set square to avoid parallax error
- More lines per mm → greater $h$ values → lower percentage uncertainty
- Measure from centre of each bright spot

**Random Errors:**
- Take multiple measurements (3-8) and find average
- Use Vernier scale to reduce percentage uncertainty
- Measure across all visible fringes and divide by number of fringes
- Increase $D$ to increase fringe separation
- Conduct in darkened room for clear fringes

**Safety Considerations:**
- Lasers should be Class 2 (max output 1 mW)
- Never allow beams into eyes
- Remove reflective surfaces from room
