# 3.4 Diffraction

## Diffraction

**Diffraction** is the spreading out of waves after they pass through a narrow gap or around an obstruction.

Diffraction effects are most noticeable when the **wavelength** of the wave and the **width of the gap** are similar in size. For light, this effect becomes significant with very **narrow** slits, such as those used in single or double slit experiments.

## Single Slit Diffraction

### Diffraction Pattern

The **diffraction pattern** of light passing through a single slit is a series of light and dark fringes on a screen:

- **Bright fringes** are areas of **maximum intensity**, produced by **constructive interference** of each part of the wavefront as it passes through the slit
- **Dark fringes** are areas of zero or minimum **intensity**, produced by **destructive interference** of each part of the wavefront as it passes through the slit

### Central Maximum Characteristics

The diffraction pattern produced by a laser beam diffracted through a single slit is different to the pattern produced through a double slit:

- The **central maximum** is:
  - Much **wider and brighter** than the other bright fringes
  - Much wider than that of the double-slit diffraction pattern
- On either side of the wide central maxima are much **narrower and less bright** maxima
- These get **dimmer** as the **order increases**

### Single Slit Intensity Pattern

For monochromatic laser light directed at a single slit (where slit width is similar to wavelength):

- The **central bright fringe** has the **greatest intensity** of any fringe and is called the **central maximum**
- The **dark fringes** are regions with **zero intensity**
- Moving away from the central maxima either side, the **intensity** of each bright fringe **gets less**

## Single Slit Diffraction with White Light

A source of white light diffracted through a single slit produces a **diffraction pattern** different to that produced by a double slit or diffraction grating:

### Central Maximum
- The **central maximum** is bright white because constructive interference from all the colours happens here
- Much **wider and brighter** than the other bright fringes

### Higher Order Maxima
- All other maxima are composed of a **spectrum**
- **Separate** diffraction patterns can be observed for each wavelength of light
- The shortest wavelength (violet/blue) appears **nearest** to the central maximum because it is diffracted less
- The longest wavelength (red) appears **furthest** from the central maximum because it is diffracted more

### Intensity Pattern for White Light
- The **central maxima** is **equal** in **intensity** to that of monochromatic light
- The **non-central** maxima are **wider** and **less intense**
- The **fringe spacing** between the maxima **get smaller**
- The amount of **red wavelengths** in the pattern **increases** with increasing maxima ($n = 1, 2, 3...$)
- The amount of **blue wavelengths decrease** with increasing maxima
- The colours look **blurry**, and further away from the central maximum, the fringe spacing gets so small that the spectra eventually merge

## Single Slit Diffraction and Young's Fringes

In Young's double slit experiment, light passing through the two slits interfere, but each slit also diffracts light like a single slit:

- The **double-slit** interference pattern has **equally** spaced intensity peaks with maxima of **equal** intensity
- The **single-slit** intensity pattern has a distinctive **central** maximum and **subsequent** maxima at lower intensity
- Together, the **combined** intensity pattern has equally spaced bright fringes but now within a single slit **'envelope'**

## Effect of Changing Variables

### Changes in Wavelength

When the **wavelength** passing through the gap is increased:
- The wave **diffracts** more
- This increases the **angle of diffraction** of the waves as they pass through the slit
- The **width** of the **bright maxima** is also **increased**

| Light Colour | Wavelength | Fringe Width |
|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Red | Longest wavelength of visible light | **Wide fringes** |
| Blue | Shorter wavelength | **Narrow fringes** |

### Changes in Slit Width

If the slit is made **narrower**:
- The **angle** of diffraction is **greater**
- The waves spread out more beyond the slit

The **intensity graph** will show that:
- The intensity of the maxima **decreases**
- The width of the central maxima **increases**
- The spacing between fringes is **wider**

**Key relationship**: When slits are made wider, fringes become narrower, and vice versa.

## The Diffraction Grating

A **diffraction grating** is a piece of **optical equipment** that creates a diffraction pattern when it diffracts:
- Monochromatic light into bright and dark fringes
- White light into its different wavelength components

A diffraction grating consists of a **large number** of very **thin**, **equally spaced parallel slits** carved into a glass plate.

### Advantages of Diffraction Gratings

Diffraction gratings create a **sharper pattern** than a double slit:
- Bright fringes are **narrower** and **brighter**
- Dark regions are wider and darker

## The Diffraction Grating Equation

The location of maxima (regions of **constructive interference** and **maximum intensity**) can be calculated using the diffraction grating equation:

$$d \sin \theta = n\lambda$$

Where:
- $n$ = the order of the maxima, the number of maxima away from the central ($n = 0$)
- $d$ = the distance between the slits on the grating (m)
- $\theta$ = the angle of diffraction of the light of order $n$ from the normal (°)
- $\lambda$ = the wavelength of the light from the source (m)

### Slit Spacing

Diffraction gratings come in **different sizes** determined by the number of **lines per millimetre** (lines/mm) or lines per m, represented by $N$.

The slit spacing $d$ can be calculated from $N$:

$$d = \frac{1}{N}$$

- If $N$ is given in lines per mm, then $d$ will be in mm
- If $N$ is given in lines per m, then $d$ will be in m

### Angular Separation

The angular separation of each maxima is calculated by rearranging the grating equation:

$$\sin \theta = \frac{n\lambda}{d}$$

The angle $\theta$ is taken from the centre, meaning higher orders of $n$ are at greater angles.

The angular separation between two angles is found by subtracting the smaller angle from the larger one. For example, the angular separation between the first and second maxima at $n_1$ and $n_2$ is $\theta_2 - \theta_1$.

### Orders of Maxima

The **maximum angle of diffraction** with which maxima can be seen is when the beam is at **right angles** to the diffraction grating:
- This means $\theta = 90°$ and $\sin \theta = 1$

The highest order of maxima visible is calculated by:

$$n = \frac{d}{\lambda}$$

Since $n$ is an integer number of maxima, if the value obtained is a decimal it must be rounded **down** to determine the highest-order visible (e.g., if $n = 2.7$, then $n = 2$ is the highest-order visible).

## Derivation of the Diffraction Grating Equation

When light passes through the slits of the diffraction grating:
- The path difference at the zeroth-order maximum is zero
- At the first order maxima, there is constructive interference, hence the path difference is $\lambda$
- At the $n$th order maxima, the path difference is equal to $n\lambda$

Using trigonometry, for the first-order maxima:

$$\sin \theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{d}$$

For $n = 2$, where the path difference is $2\lambda$:

$$\sin \theta_2 = \frac{2\lambda}{d}$$

In general, where the path difference is $n\lambda$:

$$\sin \theta_n = \frac{n\lambda}{d}$$

Rearranging gives the diffraction grating equation:

$$d \sin \theta = n\lambda$$

- The wavelength of X-rays is similar in size to the gaps between atoms
- The diffraction pattern can be used to measure the **atomic spacing** in certain materials

### Monochromators

## Worked Example

**Question**: A diffraction grating has a slit spacing of 1.7 μm. Light of wavelength 550 nm passes through it. Calculate the angle α between the two second-order lines.

**Solution**:

Step 1: Identify the equation and values
- $d \sin \theta = n\lambda$
- $n = 2$ (second order)
- $d = 1.7 \times 10^{-6}$ m
- $\lambda = 550 \times 10^{-9}$ m

Step 2: Rearrange for $\sin \theta$
$$\sin \theta = \frac{n\lambda}{d}$$

Step 3: Substitute values
$$\sin \theta = \frac{2 \times 550 \times 10^{-9}}{1.7 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.647$$

Step 4: Find θ
$$\theta = \sin^{-1}(0.647) = 40.3°$$

Step 5: Calculate total angle between both second-order lines
$$\alpha = 2 \times \theta = 2 \times 40.3° = 81° \text{ (2 s.f.)}$$

## Examiner Tips

1. **Drawing diffracted waves**: Keep the wavelength (distance between each wavefront) constant. Only the amplitude of the wave changes when diffracted.

2. **Angle measurement**: Take care that the angle θ is the correct angle taken from the centre (normal) and **not** the angle taken between two orders of maxima.

3. **Diffraction condition**: Diffraction is most prominent when the wavelength is close to the aperture size.

4. **Applications of diffraction gratings**: Avoid using vague terms such as 'observe spectra', 'spectroscopy', 'view absorption/emission spectrum'. Be specific about what is being measured or analysed.
