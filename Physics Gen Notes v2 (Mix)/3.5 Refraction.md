# 3.5 Refraction

## Refraction at a Plane Surface

### Refractive Index

The **refractive index** of a material is the ratio of how fast light travels through that particular substance compared to the speed of light in a vacuum.

$$n = \frac{c}{c_s}$$

Where:
- $n$ = refractive index of material
- $c$ = speed of light in a vacuum (m s⁻¹)
- $c_s$ = speed of light in a substance (m s⁻¹)

**Key points:**
- The refractive index is a **dimensionless** quantity (no units)
- The value of $n$ is **always greater than 1** since light in a substance always travels slower than in a vacuum
- A material with a high refractive index is called **optically dense** and causes light to travel **slower**
- In calculations, the refractive index of air can be taken to be approximately **1**

### Refraction

**Refraction** is the change in direction of a wave when it passes through a boundary between mediums of different density.

This change of direction is caused by a **change in the speed** of different parts of the wavefront as they hit the boundary. In optics, the word **medium** describes a transparent material.

### Conditions for Refraction

**When light enters a more optically dense medium:**
- The waves travel **slower**
- The angle of refraction is **smaller**
- The light bends **towards** the normal
- The refracted light has a **lower speed** and a **shorter wavelength** than the incident light

**When light enters a less optically dense medium:**
- The waves travel **faster**
- The angle of refraction is **larger**
- The light bends **away** from the normal
- The refracted light has a **higher speed** and a **longer wavelength** than the incident light

### Angles of Incidence and Refraction

- The amount of refraction is determined by the **difference** between the angles of **incidence** ($i$) and **refraction** ($r$)
- Both angles are measured from the **normal line**, which is drawn at 90° to the boundary between the two media
- The **angle of incidence** is the angle between the approaching incident ray and the normal
- The **angle of refraction** is the angle between the ray leaving the boundary and the normal

### Frequency and Wavelength During Refraction

When a wave refracts:
- Its **speed** and **wavelength** change
- Its **frequency remains the same**
- This is noticeable by the fact that the **colour** of the wave does **not change**

### Normal Incidence

When a light ray is incident on the boundary at **90°**:
- The wave passes **straight through** without changing direction
- This is because the whole wavefront enters the boundary at the same time

## Snell's Law

**Snell's law** relates the **angle of incidence** to the **angle of refraction** at a **boundary** between two media:

$$n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2$$

This can be rearranged to:

$$\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{\sin \theta_1}{\sin \theta_2}$$

Where:
- $n_1$ = refractive index of material 1
- $n_2$ = refractive index of material 2
- $\theta_1$ = angle of incidence of the ray in material 1
- $\theta_2$ = angle of refraction of the ray in material 2

**Important:** Angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are always measured from the **normal**.

## Total Internal Reflection

### Critical Angle

The **critical angle** ($\theta_c$) is the angle of incidence at which the angle of refraction equals 90°.

**Key relationship:** The larger the refractive index of a material, the smaller the critical angle.
- For a larger $n$, then $\theta_c$ is smaller

### Conditions Based on Angle of Incidence

**When angle of incidence = critical angle:**
- Angle of refraction = 90°
- The refracted ray travels **along the boundary** between the two materials

**When angle of incidence < critical angle:**
- The ray is refracted and exits the material

**When angle of incidence > critical angle:**
- The ray undergoes **total internal reflection**

### Critical Angle Equation

$$\sin \theta_c = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$$

Where:
- $n_1$ = refractive index of material 1 (the denser medium)
- $n_2$ = refractive index of material 2 (the less dense medium)
- $\theta_c$ = critical angle of material 1

The formula finds the critical angle of the **denominator** of the fraction.

The critical angle can also be calculated using the angles of incidence and refraction:

$$\sin \theta_c = \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{\sin \theta_1}{\sin \theta_2}$$

### Conditions for Total Internal Reflection

**Total internal reflection** is a special case of refraction that occurs when:

1. The **angle of incidence** within the denser medium is **greater than the critical angle** ($I > \theta_c$)
2. The incident refractive index $n_1$ is **greater** than the refractive index of the material at the boundary $n_2$ ($n_1 > n_2$)

**Total internal reflection follows the law of reflection:**

$$\text{angle of incidence} = \text{angle of reflection}$$

**Key points:**
- A **denser medium** has a **higher refractive index**
- Light rays inside a material with a higher refractive index are more likely to be **totally internally reflected**

## Fibre Optics

### Structure of Optical Fibres

Total internal reflection is used to reflect light along **optical fibres**.

The three main components of optical fibres are:
1. An optically dense **core** tube (made of plastic or glass)
2. A lower optically dense **cladding** surrounding the core
3. An **outer sheath**

This type of optical fibre is called a **step-index fibre** because the refractive index of each component increases moving from the outside to the centre of the fibre.

**For TIR to occur:** $n_{\text{cladding}} < n_{\text{core}}$

### How Optical Fibres Work

- Light (normally **monochromatic**) **refracts** when it enters the optical fibre at one end
- It undergoes repeated **total internal reflection** against the sides of the fibre until it reaches the other end
- Where it is **refracted** back out
- The light signals travel **long distances** without losing information or speed

### Role of the Cladding

The role of the **cladding** is to:
- **Protect** the thin core from damage and scratching
- **Prevent signal degradation** through light escaping the core, which can cause information from the signal to be lost
- Keep the **signals secure** and maintain the original signal quality
- Keep the **core separate** from other fibres preventing information crossover

### Applications of Optical Fibres

- **Communications** (telephone and internet transmission)
- **Medical imaging** (endoscopes)

## Material and Modal Dispersion

Both material and modal dispersion cause **pulse broadening**, where the pulses emerging from the fibre are longer than those entering.

### Material Dispersion

**Material dispersion** occurs when **white light** is used instead of monochromatic light inside an optical fibre.

- White light is separated into all the colours of the spectrum
- The beam gets wider as it travels down the optical fibre
- Each wavelength of light travels at the same speed in a vacuum but at **different speeds** in a medium

**Violet light:**
- Has the **shortest wavelength**, so it travels the **slowest** in the fibre
- Has the smallest angle of incidence on the fibre boundary
- Undergoes **more reflections**
- Takes **longer** to travel down the fibre

### Modal Dispersion

**Modal dispersion** occurs when the monochromatic light pulses in the optical fibre **spread out**.

This is because:
- Each part of the wavefront has a **different angle** of incidence and consequently a different angle of reflection
- Each part of the wavefront undergoes **total internal reflection a different number of times**
- Each part of the wavefront reaches the end of the fibre at a slightly different time

**Key points:**
- This effect is more **prominent** when the core of the fibre is **wider** (more TIR occurs)
- To prevent modal dispersion, the core needs to be very **narrow**

## Pulse Broadening and Absorption

### Absorption

The **absorption** of a signal in an optical fibre occurs when the fibre absorbs part of the signal's energy.
- This reduces the **amplitude** of the signal
- Can lead to a **loss in the information** transmitted

### Pulse Broadening

**Pulse broadening** is caused by modal and material dispersion.
- Can result in the **merging of pulses**
- **Distorts** the information in the final pulse
- **Decreases** the amplitude of the signal

### Reducing Absorption

- Use an extremely **transparent** core
- Use optical fibre **repeaters** so the pulse is regenerated before significant absorption has taken place

### Reducing Pulse Broadening

- Use a core that is as **narrow** as possible to reduce the possible differences in the path length of the signal
- Use of a **monochromatic** source so the speed of the pulse is constant
- Use optical fibre **repeaters** so the pulse is regenerated before significant pulse broadening has taken place
- Use a **single-mode fibre**, where only a single wavelength of light passes through the core, to reduce multipath modal dispersion

## Exam Tips

- Always check that the angle of incidence and refraction are the angles between the **normal** and the light ray, not the boundary. If given the angle to the boundary, calculate $90° - \theta$.
- Always double-check that calculations for refractive index give values **greater than 1**.
- In calculations, assume the refractive index of air $n_{\text{air}} = 1$ (often written as $n$ or $n_1$).
- Check that your calculator is in **degrees**, not radians.
- In a "show that" question, give answers to at least **one more significant figure** than the value given in the question.
- Remember that TIR can only occur when light travels from a **denser** to a **less dense** medium.
