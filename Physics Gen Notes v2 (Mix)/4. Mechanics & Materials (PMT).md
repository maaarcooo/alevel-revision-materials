# 4. Mechanics & Materials

## 4.1 Force, Energy and Momentum

### 4.1.1 Scalars and Vectors

**Scalars** describe only magnitude. Examples: distance, speed, mass, temperature, energy.

**Vectors** describe magnitude and direction. Examples: displacement, velocity, force/weight, acceleration, momentum.

#### Adding Vectors

**Calculation method** (for perpendicular vectors):
- Use Pythagoras to find resultant magnitude: $R = \sqrt{F_1^2 + F_2^2}$
- Use trigonometry to find direction: $\tan\theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$
- Always state how the angle signifies direction.

**Scale drawing method** (for vectors at angles other than 90°):
- Draw vectors to scale using ruler and protractor.
- Measure the resultant and convert using your scale.

#### Resolving Vectors

Splitting a vector **V** into perpendicular components (at angle θ to horizontal):

$$x = V\cos\theta \qquad y = V\sin\theta$$

**Memory aid**: Moving *through* the angle → use cos; moving *away from* the angle → use sin.

#### Equilibrium

For an object in **equilibrium**, the sum of all forces acting on it equals zero. The object is either at rest or moving at constant velocity (Newton's first law).

To show equilibrium:
- Resolve forces into components and show horizontal and vertical components sum to zero.
- For 3 forces: draw a scale diagram—if it forms a **closed triangle**, the object is in equilibrium.

### 4.1.2 Moments

**Moment** of a force about a point:

$$\text{Moment} = \text{Force} \times \text{Perpendicular distance from line of action to pivot}$$

**Couple**: A pair of coplanar forces, equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

$$\text{Moment of a couple} = \text{Force} \times \text{Perpendicular distance between lines of action}$$

**Principle of moments**: For an object in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about any point equals the sum of anticlockwise moments.

**Centre of mass**: The point at which an object's mass acts. For a **uniform** object, this is at its geometric centre.

### 4.1.3 Motion Along a Straight Line

| Quantity | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **Speed** | Scalar; how quickly an object travels |
| **Displacement (s)** | Vector; overall distance from starting position with direction |
| **Velocity (v)** | Rate of change of displacement: $v = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$ |
| **Acceleration (a)** | Rate of change of velocity: $a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$ |

**Instantaneous velocity**: Velocity at a specific moment; gradient of tangent on displacement-time graph.

**Average velocity**: Total displacement divided by total time.

**Uniform acceleration**: Constant acceleration.

#### Motion Graphs

| Graph Type | Gradient | Area Under Graph |
|------------|----------|------------------|
| Displacement-time | Velocity | — |
| Velocity-time | Acceleration | Displacement |
| Acceleration-time | — | Change in velocity |

#### SUVAT Equations (Uniform Acceleration)

$$v = u + at$$

$$s = \frac{(u + v)}{2}t$$

$$s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$

$$v^2 = u^2 + 2as$$

Where: **s** = displacement, **u** = initial velocity, **v** = final velocity, **a** = acceleration, **t** = time.

**Strategy**: List known values and identify which equation contains the unknown.

### 4.1.4 Projectile Motion

Horizontal and vertical components are **independent** and can be evaluated separately.

- Horizontal: constant velocity (no acceleration, ignoring air resistance)
- Vertical: acceleration = g = 9.81 m/s² (downward)

**Resolving initial velocity** (at angle θ to horizontal):
- Vertical component: $u_y = u\sin\theta$
- Horizontal component: $u_x = u\cos\theta$

**Maximum height**: Occurs when vertical velocity = 0.

**Free fall**: Object experiencing acceleration of g only.

#### Effects of Air Resistance

**Friction/Drag/Air resistance**: Opposes motion; converts kinetic energy to heat and sound. Magnitude increases with speed.

**Lift**: Upward force on objects in fluid; perpendicular to fluid flow direction.

**Terminal velocity**: When frictional forces equal driving forces, resulting in zero net force and constant velocity.

With air resistance, projectiles:
- Reach maximum height earlier
- Travel less horizontal and vertical distance
- Follow an asymmetric trajectory

### 4.1.5 Newton's Laws of Motion

**Newton's 1st Law**: An object remains at rest or at constant velocity unless acted upon by a resultant force.

**Newton's 2nd Law**: Resultant force equals mass times acceleration:

$$F = ma$$

**Newton's 3rd Law**: For every force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force.

**Free-body diagram**: Shows all forces acting on an object with arrows representing magnitude and direction.

---

### 4.1.6 Momentum

**Momentum**: Product of mass and velocity.

$$p = mv$$

Units: kg·m/s (or N·s)

**Conservation of momentum**: In any interaction where no external forces act, total momentum before = total momentum after.

#### Impulse

Force is the rate of change of momentum:

$$F = \frac{\Delta(mv)}{\Delta t}$$

**Impulse** = Change in momentum:

$$F\Delta t = \Delta(mv)$$

Impulse equals the **area under a force-time graph**.

**Safety applications**: Crumple zones, seat belts, and airbags increase impact time, reducing force on passengers.

#### Types of Collision

| Type | Momentum | Kinetic Energy |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Elastic** | Conserved | Conserved |
| **Inelastic** | Conserved | Not conserved (converted to heat, sound, etc.) |

If objects **stick together** after collision → inelastic.

**Explosions** are inelastic: kinetic energy increases (chemical → kinetic).

### 4.1.7 Work, Energy and Power

**Work done**: Force multiplied by displacement in direction of force.

$$W = Fs\cos\theta$$

Where θ is the angle between force and direction of motion.

For variable forces: work done = **area under force-displacement graph**.

**Power**: Rate of energy transfer.

$$P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t} = Fv$$

**Efficiency**:

$$\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Useful output power}}{\text{Input power}} \times 100\%$$

---

### 4.1.8 Conservation of Energy

**Principle of conservation of energy**: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred between forms. Total energy in a closed system remains constant.

$$\text{Total energy in} = \text{Total energy out}$$

**Gravitational potential energy**:

$$\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$$

**Kinetic energy**:

$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

In the absence of resistive forces:

$$\Delta E_p = \Delta E_k$$

**Note**: Work done against resistive forces means initial kinetic energy ≠ maximum gravitational potential energy gained.

## 4.2 Materials

### 4.2.1 Bulk Properties of Solids

**Density**: Mass per unit volume.

$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$

#### Hooke's Law

**Hooke's law**: Extension is directly proportional to applied force (under constant environmental conditions).

$$F = k\Delta L$$

Where **k** = spring constant (stiffness) and **ΔL** = extension.

**Limit of proportionality (P)**: Point beyond which Hooke's law no longer applies.

**Elastic limit (E)**: Beyond this, material undergoes **plastic deformation** (permanent stretch).

#### Stress and Strain

**Tensile stress**: Force per unit cross-sectional area.

$$\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$$

Units: Pa (N/m²)

**Tensile strain**: Extension per unit original length (dimensionless).

$$\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$$

**Breaking stress**: Stress at which material fractures; depends on conditions (e.g., temperature).

#### Elastic Strain Energy

Energy stored when material is stretched/compressed:

$$E = \frac{1}{2}F\Delta L$$

This equals the **area under a force-extension graph**.

#### Material Behaviour

| Behaviour | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Elastic** | Returns to original shape when force removed; energy stored as elastic strain energy |
| **Plastic** | Large extension beyond elastic limit; permanent deformation; energy dissipated as heat |
| **Brittle** | Little extension before fracture |
| **Ductile** | Large plastic deformation before fracture |

**Loading/unloading beyond elastic limit**: Graph doesn't return to origin; loading and unloading lines are parallel (constant stiffness). Area between curves = work done for permanent deformation.

#### Stress-Strain Graphs

Describe material behaviour (not specific object).

**Ultimate tensile stress (UTS)**: Maximum stress material can withstand (highest point on graph).

**Gradient of linear region** = Young modulus.

**Applications**:
- Crumple zones deform plastically → absorb kinetic energy
- Seat belts stretch → convert kinetic energy to elastic strain energy

---

### 4.2.2 Young Modulus

**Young modulus (E)**: Measure of material stiffness.

$$E = \frac{\text{Tensile stress}}{\text{Tensile strain}} = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}$$

Substituting definitions:

$$E = \frac{FL}{A\Delta L}$$

Units: Pa (same as stress)

**From stress-strain graph**: Young modulus = gradient of the linear (proportional) region.
