# 4.2 Moments

## Moments

A **moment** is the **turning effect of a force**. Moments occur when forces cause objects to **rotate** about some pivot.

### Calculating Moments

$$\text{Moment (N m)} = \text{Force (N)} \times \text{Perpendicular distance from pivot (m)}$$

**SI unit:** Newton metres (N m)

When the force is **not perpendicular** to the distance:

$$\text{Moment} = F \times d\cos\theta$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the force and the line from the pivot.

**Practical example:** Door handles are placed far from the hinge (pivot) to maximise the distance, providing a greater moment for a given force.

## The Principle of Moments

The **principle of moments** states:

> **For a system to be in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about a point must be equal to the sum of anticlockwise moments (about the same point).**

$$\sum \text{Clockwise moments} = \sum \text{Anticlockwise moments}$$

### Applying the Principle

For a balanced beam with forces $F_1$, $F_2$, $F_3$ at distances $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_3$ from the pivot:

$$F_2 \times d_2 = (F_1 \times d_1) + (F_3 \times d_3)$$

**Key points:**
- Ensure all distances use the same units
- Correctly identify clockwise and anticlockwise forces relative to the pivot
- For uniform objects, the weight acts at the centre of mass (geometric centre)

## Couples

A **couple** is a **pair of equal and opposite coplanar forces** that acts to produce **rotation only**.

### Conditions for a Couple

The pair of forces must be:
- **Equal in magnitude**
- **Opposite in direction**
- **Perpendicular to the distance between them**
- Acting along **different lines of action** (cannot share the same line of action)

### Properties of Couples

- Couples produce a **resultant force of zero** — the object does not accelerate (from Newton's Second Law: $F = ma$)
- Unlike moments of a single force, the moment of a couple **does not depend on a pivot**

### Moment of a Couple

$$\text{Moment of a couple} = \text{Force} \times \text{Perpendicular distance between the lines of action}$$

## Centre of Mass

The **centre of mass** of an object is **the point at which the weight of the object may be considered to act**.

### Locating the Centre of Mass

- For **uniform regular solids**: at the geometric centre
- For **symmetrical objects with uniform density**: at the **point of symmetry**
- For a person standing upright: roughly in the middle of the body behind the navel
- For a sphere: at the centre

The centre of mass is a hypothetical point — it can lie **inside or outside** the body (e.g., for a ring or curved object).

## Stability

The position of the centre of mass affects an object's **stability**.

### Conditions for Stability

- An object is **stable** when its centre of mass lies **above its base**
- If the centre of mass moves beyond the edge of the base, the object will **topple**

### Factors Affecting Stability

| Feature | Effect on Stability |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Wider base** | Lower centre of mass → **more stable** |
| **Narrower base** | Higher centre of mass → **less stable**, more likely to topple |

**Most stable objects** have **wide bases** and **low centres of mass**.

## Centre of Gravity vs Centre of Mass

| Property | Centre of Mass | Centre of Gravity |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Definition | Point where mass is concentrated | Point where weight appears to act |
| Depends on gravitational field? | **No** | **Yes** (since $W = mg$) |
| In uniform gravitational field | **Identical** to centre of gravity | **Identical** to centre of mass |

In a **non-uniform gravitational field** (e.g., an object in space near Earth):
- The centre of gravity is **displaced towards** the region of stronger gravitational field
- The centre of mass remains at the geometric centre (for uniform objects)

## Key Formulae Summary

| Quantity | Formula |
|----------|---------|
| Moment | $M = F \times d$ |
| Moment (non-perpendicular force) | $M = F \times d\cos\theta$ |
| Moment of a couple | $M = F \times \text{perpendicular distance between forces}$ |
| Principle of moments (equilibrium) | $\sum M_{\text{clockwise}} = \sum M_{\text{anticlockwise}}$ |

## Exam Tips

1. **Draw all forces** on the diagram to identify which are perpendicular to the distance from the pivot
2. **Check units** — ensure all distances are in the same units before calculating
3. **Identify the pivot** — moments are always calculated about a specific point
4. **For couples**: remember the forces must have different lines of action
5. **Uniform beams**: the weight acts at the midpoint (centre of mass)
