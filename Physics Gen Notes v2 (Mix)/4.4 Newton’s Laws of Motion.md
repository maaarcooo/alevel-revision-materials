# 4.4 Newton's Laws of Motion

Newton's laws of motion describe the relationship between the forces acting on objects and the motion of the objects.

## Newton's First Law

**An object will remain at rest or move with constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force.**

This means:
- An object at rest will remain at rest unless acted upon by a resultant force
- An object moving with a constant velocity will remain moving at that constant velocity unless acted upon by a resultant force

A **resultant force** is required to **change** the **motion** of an object:
- To speed up
- To slow down
- To change direction

If the **forces** on a body are **balanced** (the resultant force is 0), the body must be:
- At rest, or
- Moving at a constant velocity

Since force is a vector, it is easier to split forces into **horizontal** and **vertical** components. If the forces are **balanced**:
- The forces acting to the **left** = the forces acting to the **right**
- The forces acting **upward** = the forces acting **downward**

The resultant force is the **vector sum** of **all** the forces acting on the body.

## Newton's Second Law

**The resultant force acting on an object with a constant mass is directly proportional to its acceleration.**

$$F = ma$$

Where:
- $F$ = resultant force, measured in newtons (N)
- $m$ = mass of object, measured in kilograms (kg)
- $a$ = acceleration, measured in metres per second squared (m s⁻²)

This **acceleration** always acts in the **same direction** as the resultant force.

### Effect of Resultant Force on Motion

When unbalanced forces act on an object, the object experiences a **resultant force**.

- If the resultant force acts **along** the **direction** of the object's **motion**, the object will:
  - Speed up (accelerate)
  - Slow down (decelerate)

- If the resultant force acts on an object at an **angle to** its **direction** of **motion**, it will:
  - Change direction

### Resultant Force

**Force** is a **vector** quantity with both **magnitude** and **direction**.

The resultant force is the **vector sum** of all the forces acting on the body.

If the object is in motion, then the **positive direction** is in the direction of motion.

Resultant forces on a body can be positive or negative depending on their direction. If the resultant force acts at an angle to the direction of motion, the magnitude and direction can be found by:
- Combining vectors
- Scale drawings

### Acceleration

**Acceleration** is a **vector** quantity with both **magnitude** and **direction**.

- If the resultant force acts in the direction of an object's motion, the acceleration is **positive**
- If the resultant force opposes the direction of the object's motion, the acceleration is **negative**
- The acceleration will always act in the **same direction** as the **resultant force**

> **Note:** If no drag forces are present, then the acceleration of a falling object is independent of its mass.

### Newton's Second Law and Momentum

Newton's second law can also be given in terms of **momentum**:

**The resultant force on an object is equal to its rate of change of momentum.**

This change in momentum is in the **same direction** as the resultant force.

**Derivation:**

Momentum:
$$p = mv$$

Rate of change of momentum:
$$\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = m\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$$

Force:
$$F = m\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$$

Acceleration:
$$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$$

Therefore:
$$F = ma$$

## Newton's Third Law

Newton's first and second laws of motion deal with **multiple forces** acting on **a single object**.

Newton's third law deals with the forces involved when **two objects** interact.

**If Object A exerts a force on Object B, then Object B will exert a force on Object A which is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.**

When two objects interact, the forces involved arise in pairs. These are often referred to as **third-law pairs**.

### Criteria for Newton's Third Law Force Pairs

A Newton's third law force pair must be:
- The **same type** of force
- The **same magnitude**
- **Opposite** in **direction**
- Acting on **different objects**

### Example: Walking

Newton's third law explains the forces involved that enable walking:
- The **foot** pushes on the **ground** and the **ground** pushes back on the **foot**
- Both of these forces are the **normal contact force**
- The forces are of **equal magnitude**
- The forces are **opposite in direction**
- The forces are acting on **different objects** (the foot and the ground)

## Common Misconceptions and Exam Tips

1. **Newton's First Law:** The idea that an object can be in motion with no resultant force acting on it is still a common misconception. A moving object does not naturally slow down to a stop—it requires a resultant force to change its motion.

2. **Direction Convention:** It is a general rule to consider the direction of the object's motion as positive. Therefore, all vectors in the direction of motion will be positive, and opposing vectors (such as drag forces) will be negative. For stationary objects, you can choose which direction is positive as long as you are consistent. Generally: forward, upwards, and to the right are positive; backward, downwards, and to the left are negative.

3. **Deceleration vs. Reversal:** A resultant force that opposes an object's motion will cause the object to decelerate, not to suddenly travel backwards.

4. **Third Law Pairs vs. Balanced Forces:** Just because you see two forces of equal magnitude in opposite directions doesn't mean they are Newton's third law force pairs. You must apply the specific criteria—both forces must act on **different objects** and be the **same type** of force.

5. **Weight and Normal Force:** The weight of an object and the normal contact force acting on it are **not** a third-law pair because:
   - They are different types of force (gravitational vs. contact)
   - They both act on the same object

   The third-law pair for weight is: The Earth pulls on the object (weight), and the object pulls on the Earth (gravitational attraction).
