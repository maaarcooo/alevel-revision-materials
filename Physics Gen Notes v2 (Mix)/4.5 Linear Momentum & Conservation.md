# 4.5 Linear Momentum & Conservation

## Linear Momentum

**Linear momentum** is the momentum of an object moving in only one dimension.

**Momentum** is defined as the product of mass and velocity:

$$p = mv$$

Where:
- $p$ = momentum (kg m s⁻¹)
- $m$ = mass (kg)
- $v$ = velocity (m s⁻¹)

Momentum is a **vector** quantity with both **magnitude** and **direction**. The initial direction of motion is usually assigned the positive direction; motion in the opposite direction has negative velocity and therefore negative momentum.

The linear momentum of an object remains **constant** unless the system is acted upon by an external resultant force.

## Conservation of Momentum

### The Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum

> **The total momentum before a collision is equal to the total momentum after a collision, provided no external force acts.**

For objects A and B colliding:

$$p_{Ai} + p_{Bi} = p_{Af} + p_{Bf}$$

Or equivalently:

$$m_A u_A + m_B u_B = m_A v_A + m_B v_B$$

Key points:
- Opposing vectors can cancel each other out, resulting in a **net momentum of zero**
- An object that collides and **rebounds** has positive velocity before and **negative** velocity after
- A stationary object has momentum of **zero**

### External and Internal Forces

- **External forces**: Forces acting on a system from outside (e.g., friction, weight)
- **Internal forces**: Forces exchanged by particles within the system (e.g., tension in a string)

Systems with no external forces are described as **'closed'** or **'isolated'** — in these systems, total momentum is conserved.

## Impulse

### Force and Momentum

Force can be defined as the **rate of change of momentum**:

$$F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$

Where:
- $F$ = resultant force (N)
- $\Delta p$ = change in momentum (kg m s⁻¹)
- $\Delta t$ = change in time (s)

The change in momentum is:

$$\Delta p = p_{final} - p_{before} = mv - mu$$

### Definition of Impulse

**Impulse** occurs when an external resultant force acts on an object for a very short time and changes the object's motion (e.g., kicking a ball, catching a ball, collisions).

**Impulse** is the product of the force applied and the time for which it acts:

$$\text{Impulse} = F\Delta t = \Delta p = mv - mu$$

- Impulse is measured in **newton seconds (N s)**
- Impulse is a **vector** quantity, always in the direction of the resultant force
- A **small force over a long time** has the same effect as a **large force over a short time**

### Examples of Impulse

**Rain vs Hail on an umbrella:**
- Water droplets splatter with small change in momentum
- Hailstones bounce back with greater change in momentum
- More force is required to hold an umbrella upright in hail than rain

**Preventing injury (e.g., catching a cricket ball):**
- A fielder moves their hands backwards when catching
- This **increases the time** for the change in momentum to occur
- Therefore, **less force** is exerted on the hands, reducing injury risk

## Impulse on a Force-Time Graph

When force varies over time, the **impulse equals the area under the force-time graph**.

This is because: Impulse = Force × Change in time

Methods to find area:
- **Curved graphs**: Count squares underneath
- **Straight-line graphs**: Split into geometric sections (rectangles, triangles, trapeziums) and sum the areas

The impulse is equal whether there is a small force over a long time or a large force over a short time — the area under the graph remains the same.

## Collisions

### Elastic and Inelastic Collisions

In both collisions and explosions, **momentum is always conserved**. However, **kinetic energy** might not be.

| Collision Type | Kinetic Energy | Typical Behaviour |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Elastic** | Conserved | Objects move apart in opposite directions |
| **Inelastic** | Not conserved | Objects stick together after collision |

To determine collision type, compare total kinetic energy before and after:

$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

**Explosions** involve recoil (e.g., gun firing a bullet, radioactive decay emitting particles). Initial momentum is zero, so final momenta must be equal and opposite.

## Momentum Conservation and Safety Features

### Reducing Impact Forces

Impact forces are **reduced** by **increasing the contact time** over which the collision occurs.

From $F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$: for a given change in momentum, increasing $\Delta t$ decreases $F$.

### Vehicle Safety Features

**Seat belts:**
- Keep passengers fixed to their seat during abrupt stops
- Designed to **stretch slightly**, increasing contact time
- Reduces force exerted on passenger during collision

**Airbags:**
- Deploy from dashboard/steering wheel/doors during collision
- Act as a soft cushion, preventing impact with hard interior
- **Increase contact time** over which passenger's momentum changes

**Crumple zones:**
- Located at front and back of vehicles
- Designed to **crush in a controlled way**
- Increase time over which vehicle's momentum reaches zero
- Reduce force on passengers

### Force-Time Graph Representation

For the same impulse (change in momentum):
- **Without safety features**: High peak force, short contact time
- **With safety features**: Lower peak force, longer contact time (wider base)

The **area under both curves is equal** (same impulse), but the maximum force is significantly reduced.

## Exam Tips

- **Unit conversions**: Convert mass from grams to kg (÷1000); velocity from km s⁻¹ to m s⁻¹ (×1000)
- **Sign convention**: Choose a positive direction and maintain consistency throughout — objects moving opposite to this have negative velocity
- **Stationary objects**: Have zero momentum ($v = 0$, so $p = 0$)
- **Combined objects**: After collision where objects stick together, treat as single object with combined mass
- **Vector nature**: Velocity, momentum, impulse, and force are all vectors — direction matters!
- **Base units**: 1 N = 1 kg m s⁻², which is why $F\Delta t = \Delta p$ (kg m s⁻² × s = kg m s⁻¹)
