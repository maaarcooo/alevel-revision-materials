# 4.6 Work, Energy & Power

## Work & Power

### Work Done

**Work done** by a force is equivalent to a **transfer of energy**.

- The unit of work done is **newton metres (N m)**
- $1 \text{ N m} = 1 \text{ J}$

The work done by a **resultant force** on a system equals the change in energy in that system.

**Mechanical work** is defined as:

> The amount of energy transferred when an external force causes an object to move over a certain distance.

#### Work Done with Force Parallel to Displacement

If a constant force is applied **parallel** to the direction of the object's displacement:

$$W = Fs$$

Where:
- $W$ = work done (J)
- $F$ = average force applied (N)
- $s$ = displacement (m)

#### Work Done with Force at an Angle

If the force is at an angle $\theta$ to the object's displacement:

$$W = Fs \cos \theta$$

Where $\theta$ is the angle between the direction of the force and the motion of the object.

**Key points:**
- When $\theta = 0$ (force in direction of motion), $\cos \theta = 1$ and $W = Fs$
- For **horizontal motion**, use $\cos \theta$
- For **vertical motion**, use $\sin \theta$
- The component needed is the one **parallel to the displacement**

When pushing a block, **work is done against friction** and energy is transferred. Some energy is **dissipated** to the surroundings by heating and as sound.

### Power

**Power** is the rate of doing work or the rate of **energy transfer**.

$$P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}$$

Where:
- $P$ = power (W)
- $\Delta W$ = change in work done (J)
- $\Delta t$ = change in time (s)

Power is increased if:
- There is a greater energy transfer (work done)
- The energy is transferred over a shorter period of time

#### Power for Constant Velocity

If an object is moving at **constant velocity** with a **constant force**:

$$P = Fv$$

Where:
- $F$ = force (N)
- $v$ = velocity (m s⁻¹)

**Important:** The force must be in the direction of the velocity. Otherwise, use the **component** of the force in the direction of velocity.

## Area Under a Force-Displacement Graph

The work done by a force acting over a distance can be found from a **force-displacement graph**.

If the force is not constant and is plotted against displacement:

> **Work done = Area under the force-displacement graph**

This is because: Work done = Force × Displacement

The work done is equivalent whether there is:
- A **small force** over a **long displacement**
- A **large force** over a **small displacement**

The graph may need to be split into sections (rectangles, triangles, trapeziums). The total area is the sum of the areas of each section.

### Variable Forces

A **variable force** is when the force on an object is not constant - this is more representative of real-life situations.

- If force is **constant**: use $W = Fs$ and $P = Fv$
- If force is **varying**: work done must be found from the area under the force-displacement graph

If a varying force increases, then an object's acceleration increases and vice versa.

## Efficiency

**Efficiency** is a measure of how successfully energy is transferred in a system.

> The ratio of the useful power output from a system to its total power input.

- **High efficiency**: most of the energy transferred is **useful**
- **Low efficiency**: most of the energy transferred is **wasted**

### Efficiency Equations

Using power:

$$\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Useful power output}}{\text{Total power input}} \times 100\%$$

Using energy:

$$\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Useful energy output}}{\text{Total energy input}} \times 100\%$$

Where power = $\frac{\text{Energy}}{\text{Time}}$

### Useful vs Wasted Energy

What counts as useful or wasted depends on the system:

| Device | Useful Energy | Wasted Energy |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Lightbulb | Light | Thermal (heat) |
| Heater | Thermal (heat) | Sound |

**Note:** Efficiency can be expressed as a ratio (0 to 1) or percentage (0% to 100%). Efficiency has **no units**.

## Conservation of Energy

### The Principle of Conservation of Energy

> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be transferred from one form to another.

The total amount of energy in a **closed system** remains constant, although how much of each form there is may change.

### Types of Energy

| Form | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Kinetic** | The energy of a moving object |
| **Gravitational Potential** | Energy gained when lifting an object, lost when it falls |
| **Elastic** | Energy of a stretched spring or elastic band (strain energy) |
| **Chemical** | Energy contained in a chemical substance |
| **Nuclear** | Energy contained within the nucleus of an atom |
| **Internal (Thermal)** | Energy due to temperature or state |

### Energy Dissipation

- No energy transfer is 100% efficient
- When energy is transferred, some is **dissipated** to the surroundings
- Dissipated energy is usually **wasted energy** as it cannot easily be used
- Common forms: **thermal (heat), light or sound** energy

### Applications of Energy Conservation

Common energy transfers:

- **Falling object (in vacuum):** Gravitational potential energy → Kinetic energy
- **Battery:** Chemical energy → Electrical energy
- **Horizontal mass on spring:** Elastic potential energy → Kinetic energy

When there is work done against resistive forces (e.g., friction on a rough inclined surface):

> Loss in KE = Gain in GPE + Work done against friction

### Energy Equations Summary

$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

$$\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$$

$$E_{elastic} = \frac{1}{2}k(\Delta L)^2$$

## Kinetic & Gravitational Potential Energy

### Kinetic Energy

**Kinetic energy** is the energy an object has due to its **motion** (or velocity).

- The faster an object moves, the greater its kinetic energy
- When an object falls, it **gains** kinetic energy (from losing GPE)

$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

Where:
- $E_k$ = kinetic energy (J)
- $m$ = mass (kg)
- $v$ = velocity (m s⁻¹)

**Note:** Only the speed is squared, not the mass or the ½.

---

### Gravitational Potential Energy

**Gravitational potential energy** is energy stored in a mass due to its position in a gravitational field.

- If a mass is **lifted up**, it **gains** GPE
- If a mass **falls**, it **loses** GPE

For energy changes in a **uniform gravitational field**:

$$\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$$

Where:
- $\Delta E_p$ = change in gravitational potential energy (J)
- $m$ = mass (kg)
- $g$ = gravitational field strength (9.81 N kg⁻¹)
- $\Delta h$ = change in height (m)

**Key points:**
- Potential energy at ground level is usually taken as zero
- Any position can be taken as zero when calculating **change** in GPE
- This equation only applies near Earth's surface (uniform gravitational field)

### GPE vs Height Graphs

- GPE and height have a **linear relationship** (straight line graph)
- Graph of GPE against time would be identical for a thrown/falling ball

## Exam Tips

1. **Work done with angles:** Ensure you use the force component **parallel** to the direction of motion. You may need to resolve the force vector first.

2. **Force-displacement graphs:** Always check the units on axes. Convert kN to N and km to m before calculating work done in joules.

3. **Sketching graphs:** Label key points on axes from the question - graphs don't need to be to scale.

4. **Efficiency:** Can be ratio (0-1) or percentage (0-100%). Remember to multiply by 100 if percentage is required. Efficiency has no units.

5. **Kinetic energy:** Only velocity is squared, not mass. For 'loss of kinetic energy', don't include negative sign as energy is scalar.

6. **GPE equation:** Only valid near Earth's surface where gravitational field is uniform. At A-level, consider non-uniform fields in space.

7. **Energy transfers:** Identify the energy stores involved in the system. A ball rolling downhill transfers GPE to KE; a spring converts elastic PE to KE.
