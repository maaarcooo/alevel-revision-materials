# 5. Electricity

## 5.1 Basics of Electricity

**Electric current (I)** is the flow of charge per unit time, or the **rate of flow of charge**.

$$I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$$

where $Q$ is charge (C) and $t$ is time (s). Current is measured in amperes (A).

**Potential difference (V)** is the **energy transferred per unit charge** between two points in a circuit.

$$V = \frac{W}{Q}$$

where $W$ is energy transferred (J) and $Q$ is charge (C). Potential difference is measured in volts (V).

**Resistance (R)** is a measure of how difficult it is for charge carriers to pass through a component, calculated by dividing the potential difference across a component by the current flowing through it.

$$R = \frac{V}{I}$$

Resistance is measured in ohms (Ω).

## 5.2 Current-Voltage Characteristics

### Ohm's Law

**Ohm's law** states that for an **ohmic conductor**, current is **directly proportional to the potential difference** across it, provided that physical conditions (e.g., temperature) are kept **constant**.

### I-V Characteristics of Components

**Ohmic conductor**: Follows Ohm's law, so its I-V graph is a straight line through the origin (provided physical conditions are kept constant). Resistance remains constant.

**Semiconductor diode**: Has two bias directions:
- **Forward bias**: The direction in which current flows easily past the **threshold voltage** (the minimum voltage needed to allow current to flow)
- **Reverse bias**: Resistance is extremely high, allowing only a very small current to flow

**Filament lamp**: Contains a metal wire which **heats up as current increases**, therefore resistance increases as current increases. At very low currents, Ohm's law is obeyed. As current increases (in either direction), the graph curves due to increasing resistance.

### Ammeter and Voltmeter Assumptions

- **Ammeters**: Assumed to have **zero resistance** (do not affect current measurement)
- **Voltmeters**: Assumed to have **infinite resistance** (no current flows through them, giving exact p.d. measurements)

## 5.3 Resistivity

**Resistivity (ρ)** is a measure of how easily a material conducts electricity. It is defined as the product of resistance and cross-sectional area, divided by the length of the material.

$$\rho = \frac{RA}{L}$$

where $R$ is resistance (Ω), $A$ is cross-sectional area (m²), and $L$ is length (m). Resistivity is measured in Ω m.

Resistivity gives the resistance of a material with length 1 m and cross-sectional area 1 m², useful for comparing materials of different sizes. Resistivity is dependent on environmental factors such as **temperature**.

### Effect of Temperature on Resistance

**Metal conductors**: When temperature increases, **resistance increases**. This occurs because:
1. Metal atoms gain kinetic energy and vibrate more
2. Charge carriers (electrons) collide with atoms more frequently
3. Electrons slow down, current decreases
4. Since $R = V/I$, resistance increases

**Thermistors**: The opposite behaviour — **as temperature increases, resistance decreases**. This occurs because:
1. Increased temperature causes electrons to be emitted from atoms
2. The number of charge carriers increases
3. Current increases, causing resistance to decrease

**Application**: Thermistors are used as **temperature sensors** to trigger events when temperature reaches a certain value (e.g., turning on heating when room temperature drops below a set point).

### Superconductors

A **superconductor** is a material which, below a certain temperature called the **critical temperature**, has **zero resistivity**.

- Critical temperature depends on the material
- Most known superconductors have extremely low critical temperatures close to 0 K (−273°C)

**Applications of superconductors**:
- **Power cables**: Zero energy loss through heating during transmission
- **Strong magnetic fields**: No constant power source required; used in **maglev trains** (no friction between train and rail) and certain **medical applications**

## 5.4 Circuits

### Combining Resistors

**Resistors in series**:
$$R_T = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots$$

**Resistors in parallel**:
$$\frac{1}{R_T} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots$$

### Power and Energy

**Power (P)** is the energy transferred over time (rate of transfer of energy).

$$P = \frac{E}{t}$$

where $E$ is energy transferred (J) and $t$ is time (s).

Combined with $V = IR$, power can be expressed as:

$$P = VI = \frac{V^2}{R} = I^2R$$

**Energy transferred**:
$$E = VIt$$

### Series Circuit Rules

- **Current is the same** everywhere in the circuit
- The battery p.d. is shared across all elements; the **total sum of the voltages across all elements equals the supply p.d.**

### Parallel Circuit Rules

- The **sum of the currents in each parallel branch equals the total current**
- The **potential difference across each branch is the same**

### Combining Cells

**Cells in series**: Total voltage equals the sum of individual cell voltages:
$$V_T = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + \ldots$$

**Identical cells in parallel**: Total voltage equals the voltage of one cell (current splits equally between branches):
$$V_T = V_1 = V_2 = V_3 = \ldots$$

### Kirchhoff's Laws

In DC circuits, **charge and energy are always conserved**.

**Kirchhoff's first law**: The **total current flowing into a junction equals the current flowing out** of that junction. (Conservation of charge)

**Kirchhoff's second law**: The **sum of all the voltages in a series circuit equals the battery voltage**. (Conservation of energy)

## 5.5 Potential Divider

A **potential divider** is a circuit with several resistors in series connected across a voltage source, used to **produce a required fraction of the source potential difference**.

For two resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ in series with source voltage $V_s$, the output voltage across $R_2$ is:

$$V_{out} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \times V_s$$

### Variable Output

Using a **variable resistor** as one component allows the output p.d. to be varied. If resistance across $R_1$ increases, circuit current decreases, so output p.d. decreases (since $V = IR$).

### Sensor Circuits

**Light dependent resistor (LDR)**: **Resistance decreases as light intensity increases**.

**Thermistor**: Resistance decreases as temperature increases.

These components can be used in potential dividers to trigger events:
- If an LDR is at $R_1$ position and light intensity falls, $R_1$ increases, circuit current decreases, and $V_{out}$ decreases
- Swapping positions reverses the effect (e.g., $V_{out}$ increases as light decreases, which could trigger a lamp to switch on when a threshold voltage is reached)

## 5.6 Electromotive Force and Internal Resistance

### Internal Resistance

Batteries have an **internal resistance (r)** caused by electrons colliding with atoms inside the battery. Some energy is lost before electrons leave the battery.

### Electromotive Force (EMF)

**Electromotive force (emf, ε)** is the **energy transferred by a cell per coulomb of charge** that passes through it:

$$\varepsilon = \frac{E}{Q}$$

### Circuit Equations

Total resistance in a circuit with internal resistance:
$$R_T = R + r$$

where $R$ is the load resistance and $r$ is internal resistance.

EMF equation:
$$\varepsilon = IR + Ir = I(R + r)$$

**Terminal p.d. (V)**: The p.d. across the external load resistance $R$:
$$V = IR$$

**Lost volts (v)**: The p.d. across the internal resistance $r$, equal to energy wasted by the cell per coulomb:
$$v = Ir$$

Therefore:
$$\varepsilon = V + v$$

### Measuring EMF

The emf of a battery can be measured by measuring the voltage across a cell using a voltmeter when there is **no current** running through the cell (i.e., in an **open circuit**).
