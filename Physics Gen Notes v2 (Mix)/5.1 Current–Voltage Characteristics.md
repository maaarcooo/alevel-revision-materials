# 5.1 Current–Voltage Characteristics

## Basics of Electricity

A simple electrical circuit requires:
- A **conductor** through which **current** can flow
- A source of **potential difference**

---

## Electric Current

**Electric current** is defined as:

> **The rate of flow of electric charge**

Current is measured in units of **amperes** or **amps (A)**.

$$I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$$

Where:
- $I$ = current (A)
- $\Delta Q$ = amount of charge flowing (C)
- $\Delta t$ = time interval (s)

**Unit equivalence:** 1 A = 1 C s⁻¹ (one ampere is equivalent to a charge of one coulomb flowing in one second)

### Current Flow

Current flows when a circuit is formed—this occurs when a conductor (such as a wire) connects the two oppositely charged terminals of an electrical energy source (such as a cell).

In electric circuits, the current is a flow of **electrons**.

### Conventional Current vs Electron Flow

**Conventional current** is defined as the flow of positive charge:
- Flows from the **positive** terminal of a cell to the **negative** terminal
- This is the **opposite** of the direction of electron flow

**Electrons** are **negatively** charged, so they flow from the **negative** terminal of a cell to the **positive** terminal.

### Measuring Current

Current can be measured using an **ammeter**.

**Ammeters must be connected in series** with the component being measured.

## Potential Difference

**Potential difference** is defined as:

> **The electrical work done per unit charge flowing between two points**

Potential difference is measured in units of **volts (V)**.

$$V = \frac{W}{Q}$$

Where:
- $V$ = potential difference (V)
- $W$ = electrical work done by the charge (J)
- $Q$ = charge flow (C)

**Unit equivalence:** 1 V = 1 J C⁻¹ (one volt is equivalent to the transfer of one joule of electrical energy by one coulomb of charge)

### How Cells Create Potential Difference

A simple cell creates a potential difference through the **separation of charge**:
- One end (**terminal**) of the cell has an excess of **positive** charge and the other an excess of **negative** charge
- Negatively charged **electrons** are **repelled** by the negative terminal and **attracted** to the positive terminal
- Therefore, when a wire is connected between the two terminals, the potential difference **causes** the flow of electrons (**current**)

### Energy Transfer

- As electrons flow through a cell, they **gain** energy
  - Example: In a 12 V cell, every coulomb of charge passing through gains 12 J of energy

- As electrons flow through a circuit, they **lose** energy
  - Example: After leaving the 12 V cell, each coulomb of charge will transfer 12 J of energy to the wires and components in the circuit

### Measuring Potential Difference

Potential difference can be measured using a **voltmeter**.

**Voltmeters must be set up in parallel** with the component being measured.

## Resistance

**Resistance** is defined as:

> **The opposition of a component to the flow of electric current through it**

The resistance $R$ of a conductor is defined as the ratio of the potential difference $V$ across it to the current $I$ in it:

$$R = \frac{V}{I}$$

Where:
- $R$ = resistance of a conductor (Ω)
- $V$ = potential difference across the conductor (V)
- $I$ = current in the conductor (A)

Resistance is measured in units of **ohms (Ω)**.

**Unit equivalence:** A resistance of 1 Ω is equivalent to a potential difference across a component of 1 V which produces a current of 1 A through it.

### Effect of Resistance on Current

The resistance of a component controls the size of the current in a circuit.

For a given potential difference across a component:
- The **higher** the resistance, the **lower** the current that can flow
- The **lower** the resistance, the **higher** the current that can flow

### Resistance in Circuit Components

All electrical components, including wires, possess some value of resistance.

Wires are often made from copper because of its **low** electrical resistance—this is why it is known as a **good conductor**.

**Exam Note:** Although all electrical components have resistance, the resistance of wires is taken to be **zero** in exam questions.

## Ohm's Law

**Ohm's law** states:

> **For a conductor at a constant temperature, the current through it is proportional to the potential difference across it**

Constant temperature implies constant resistance.

Ohm's law is represented by the equation:

$$V = IR$$

### Investigating Ohm's Law

The relationship between potential difference across an electrical component and the current can be investigated using a circuit containing:
- A voltage supply
- A fixed resistor (test component)
- A variable resistor
- A voltmeter (connected in parallel with the fixed resistor)
- An ammeter (connected in series)

By adjusting the resistance on the variable resistor, the current and potential difference will vary in the circuit.

### Interpreting I–V Graphs

For a graph of current ($I$) against potential difference ($V$):
- The gradient equals $\frac{\Delta I}{\Delta V} = \frac{1}{R}$
- Since the gradient is constant for an ohmic conductor, the resistance $R$ can be calculated using **1 ÷ gradient** of the graph

**An electrical component obeys Ohm's law if its graph of current against potential difference is a straight line through the origin.**

- A resistor **does** obey Ohm's law
- A filament lamp does **not** obey Ohm's law

This applies to any metal wires, provided that the current isn't large enough to increase their temperature.

## I–V Characteristics

As the potential difference (voltage) across a component is increased, the current also increases (by Ohm's law). The precise relationship between voltage and current is different for different components and can be shown on an **I–V graph**.

### Summary of I–V Characteristics

| Component | I–V Graph Shape | Key Features |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Ohmic conductor (resistor) | Straight line through origin | Constant gradient; current directly proportional to p.d. |
| Semiconductor diode | Horizontal line that goes sharply upwards | Conducts in one direction only |
| Filament lamp | 'S' shaped curve | Gradient decreases as p.d. increases |

### Ohmic Conductor (Resistor)

The I–V graph for an ohmic conductor at constant temperature is a **straight line through the origin**:
- The current is **directly proportional** to the potential difference
- The gradient (and therefore resistance) is **constant**

### Semiconductor Diode

A diode is used in a circuit to allow current to flow only in a specific direction.

**Forward bias:**
- When the current is in the direction of the arrowhead symbol
- Shown by the sharp increase in potential difference and current on the right side of the graph

**Reverse bias:**
- When the diode is switched around, it does not conduct
- Shown by a zero reading of current or potential difference on the left side of the graph

### Filament Lamp

The I–V graph for a filament lamp shows the current increasing at a **proportionally slower rate** than the potential difference.

**Explanation:**
1. As the current increases, the **temperature** of the filament in the lamp **increases**
2. Since the filament is a metal, the higher temperature causes an **increase in resistance**
3. Resistance opposes the current, causing the **current** to **increase** at a **slower rate**

**Key features:**
- Where the graph is a straight line, the resistance is constant
- The resistance increases as the graph curves
- The filament lamp obeys Ohm's Law for small voltages only

## Exam Tips

1. **Voltage vs Potential Difference:** While "voltage" is a valid term, use "potential difference" to describe the difference in potential (energy per unit charge) between two points in a circuit.

2. **Potential Difference ≠ Energy:** Remember that potential difference is the energy *per unit charge*, not energy itself. Since $W = QV$, two batteries may have the same voltage but store different amounts of energy.

3. **I–V Graph Gradients:**
   - Increasing gradient → decreasing resistance
   - Decreasing gradient → increasing resistance
   - Constant gradient → constant resistance
   - No gradient (horizontal) → infinite resistance

4. **Drawing I–V Characteristics:** Be confident in sketching I–V characteristics for different components from memory—this is commonly examined.

5. **Finding Resistance from I–V Graphs:** For a graph of $I$ against $V$, resistance = 1 ÷ gradient. For a graph of $V$ against $I$, resistance = gradient.
