# 5.2 Resistance & Resistivity

## Resistivity

### Origin of Resistance

All materials have some **resistance** to the flow of charge. As **free electrons move** through a metal wire, they collide with ions which get in their way. As a result, they **transfer** some, or all, of their **kinetic energy** on **collision**, which causes electrical **heating**.

Since **current** is the **flow** of **charge**, the ions resisting their flow causes **resistance**.

### Factors Affecting Resistance

Resistance depends on:
- The **length** of the wire
- The **cross-sectional area** through which the current is passing
- The **resistivity** of the material

### The Resistivity Equation

$$R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$$

Where:
- $R$ = resistance (Ω)
- $\rho$ = resistivity (Ω m)
- $L$ = length (m)
- $A$ = cross-sectional area (m²)

The resistivity equation shows that:
- The **longer** the wire, the **greater** its resistance
- The **thicker** the wire, the **smaller** its resistance

### Understanding Resistivity

**Resistivity** is a property that describes the extent to which a material opposes the flow of electric current through it.

Key points:
- It is a property of the **material**, and is **dependent on temperature**
- Resistivity is measured in **Ω m**
- The **higher** the resistivity of a material, the **higher** its resistance

### Resistivity of Materials at Room Temperature

| Category | Material | Resistivity / Ω m |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Metals** | Copper | $1.7 \times 10^{-8}$ |
| | Gold | $2.4 \times 10^{-8}$ |
| | Aluminium | $2.6 \times 10^{-8}$ |
| **Semiconductors** | Germanium | $0.6$ |
| | Silicon | $2.3 \times 10^{3}$ |
| **Insulators** | Glass | $10^{12}$ |
| | Sulfur | $10^{15}$ |

**Applications:**
- Copper, with its relatively low resistivity at room temperature, is used for electrical wires — current flows through it very easily
- Insulators have such a high resistivity that virtually no current will flow through them

### Cross-Sectional Area Calculation

For a circular wire:

$$A = \pi r^2 = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}$$

**Important:** If the cross-sectional area is a circle, it is proportional to the diameter squared. This means if the diameter doubles, the area quadruples, causing the resistance to drop by a quarter.

## Resistance in a Thermistor

### Temperature and Resistance in Metals

All solids are made up of vibrating atoms. The higher the temperature, the faster these atoms vibrate.

Electric current is the flow of free electrons in a material. The electrons collide with the vibrating atoms which impede their flow, hence the current **decreases**.

If the current decreases, then the resistance will increase (from $V = IR$).

Therefore, for a **metallic conductor** which obeys Ohm's law:
- An **increase** in temperature causes an **increase** in resistance
- A **decrease** in temperature causes a **decrease** in resistance

### Thermistor Behaviour

This is **not** the case for components such as a thermistor.

For a thermistor, an **increase** in temperature causes a **decrease** in resistance.

### Applications of a Thermistor

A **thermistor** is a **non-ohmic conductor** and **sensory resistor** whose resistance varies with temperature.

Most thermistors are **negative temperature coefficient (NTC)** components:
- If the temperature **increases**, the resistance of the thermistor **decreases** (and vice versa)

**Behaviour summary:**
- As the thermistor gets **hotter**, its resistance **decreases**
- As the thermistor gets **cooler**, its resistance **increases**

**Applications:** Thermistors are temperature sensors used in circuits in:
- Ovens
- Fire alarms
- Digital thermometers

## Superconductivity

### Introduction to Superconductivity

All materials have some resistivity — even good electrical conductors such as copper and silver.

Resistance means that when electricity flows through a material, it heats up and the electrical energy is wasted as thermal energy.

The resistivity of a material can be lowered by lowering its temperature.

If a material is cooled below a temperature called the **critical temperature**, its resistivity disappears entirely. It is now a **superconductor**.

### Key Definitions

**Superconductor (or superconducting material):**
> A material with no resistance below a critical temperature

**Critical temperature (or transition temperature):**
> The temperature at which a material becomes superconducting

**Example:** Mercury has a critical temperature of **4.2 K**

### Resistivity vs Temperature Graph

For a **normal metal**: resistivity decreases gradually as temperature decreases, but never reaches zero.

For a **superconductor**: resistivity drops suddenly to zero at the critical temperature $T_c$.

### Applications of Superconductors

Superconductors are useful for applications that require large electric currents.

**Primary benefits:**
- The production of **strong magnetic fields**
- The **reduction of energy loss/dissipation** in the transmission of electric power

**Specific applications:**
- MRI scanners
- Transformers and generators (for fewer fire risks)
- Motors
- Monorail trains
- Maglev (magnetic levitation) trains
- Particle accelerators (need large magnetic fields to accelerate particles)
- Fusion reactors
- Electromagnets
- Power/electrical cables
- Microchips

**Maglev trains:** Require extremely strong electromagnets to levitate the train due to such a large mass. They can travel at extremely high speeds up to 603 km/h. Maglev train systems currently exist in Japan, South Korea, and China.

## Required Practical: Investigating Resistivity

### Aims of the Experiment

To determine the resistivity of a 2 metre constantan wire.

### Variables

| Variable Type | Variable | Unit |
|---------------|----------|------|
| Independent | Length, $L$, of the wire | m |
| Dependent | Current, $I$, through the wire | A |
| Control | Voltage through the wire | V |
| Control | Material of the wire | — |

### Equipment

| Equipment | Purpose | Resolution |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Ammeter | To determine the current through the wire | 0.01 A |
| Voltmeter | To determine the voltage across the wire | 0.1 V |
| 2.0 m of constantan wire (22–36 swg) | To calculate its resistivity | — |
| Flying lead | A wire with a crocodile clip at one end to allow connection at any point along the test wire | — |
| Metre ruler | To measure the length of the wire | 1 mm |
| Micrometer screw gauge | To measure the diameter of the wire | 0.01 mm |
| Power supply | To provide the voltage through the wire | — |

### Method

1. Measure the diameter of the constantan wire using a micrometer.
   - Take measurements 5–10 times randomly along the wire
   - Calculate the mean diameter from these values

2. Set up the equipment so the wire is taped or clamped to the ruler with one end of the circuit attached to the wire where the ruler reads 0.
   - The ammeter is connected in **series** and the voltmeter in **parallel** to the wire

3. Attach the flying lead to the test wire at 0.25 m

4. Set the power supply at a voltage of 6.0 V.
   - Check that this is the voltage through the wire on the voltmeter

5. Read and record the current from the ammeter, then switch off the current immediately after the reading.
   - This is to prevent the wire from heating up and changing the resistivity

6. Vary the distance between the fixed end of the wire and the flying lead in 0.25 m intervals (0.25 m, 0.50 m, 0.75 m, etc.) until the full length of the 2.0 m wire.
   - The original length and intervals can be changed (e.g., start at 0.1 m and increase in 0.1 m intervals), as long as there are 8–10 readings

7. Record the current for each length at least 3 times and calculate an average current, $I$

8. For each length, calculate the average resistance using:

$$R = \frac{V}{I}$$

### Analysis of Results

The resistivity equation:

$$\rho = \frac{RA}{L}$$

Rearranging for resistance:

$$R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$$

Comparing to the equation of a straight line $y = mx$:
- $y = R$
- $x = L$
- Gradient, $m = \frac{\rho}{A}$

**To find resistivity:**
1. Plot a graph of the length of the wire, $L$, against the average resistance of the wire, $R$
2. Draw a line of best fit
3. Calculate the gradient
4. Multiply the gradient by cross-sectional area, $A$

$$\rho = \text{gradient} \times A$$

**Cross-sectional area:**

$$A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}$$

### Evaluating the Experiment

**Systematic Errors:**
- The end of the wire that is attached to the circuit (not the flying lead) must start at 0 on the ruler
- Otherwise, this could cause a **zero error** in measurements of the length

**Random Errors:**
- Only allow **small currents** to flow through the wire
  - The resistivity of a material depends on its temperature
  - The current flowing through the wire will cause its temperature to increase and affect its resistance and resistivity
  - Therefore, the temperature is kept constant and low by using small currents
- The current should be **switched off between readings** so its temperature doesn't change its resistance
- Make at least **5–10 measurements** of the diameter of the wire with the micrometer screw gauge and calculate an average diameter to reduce random errors

### Safety Considerations

- When there is a high current, and a thin wire, the wire will become very hot
- Make sure **never to touch the wire directly** when the circuit is switched on
- **Switch off the power supply** right away if you smell burning
- Make sure there are **no liquids close to the equipment**, as this could damage the electrical equipment

## Exam Tips

1. **Resistivity values** will be given in the exam question — you do not need to memorise them.

2. **Diameter and area relationship:** Remember that if the cross-sectional area is circular (e.g., in a wire), it is proportional to the diameter squared. If the diameter doubles, the area quadruples, causing the resistance to drop by a quarter.

3. **Superconductivity:** Superconductivity occurs when there is **no** resistance. Avoid writing that there is a 'little' resistance or 'thermal' conductivity, which are not entirely correct.

4. **Thermistor vs metal:** Be clear about the opposite temperature-resistance relationships:
   - Metals: temperature ↑ → resistance ↑
   - NTC Thermistors: temperature ↑ → resistance ↓
