# 5.3 Circuits & The Potential Divider

## Resistors in Series & Parallel

### Resistors in Series

When two or more components are connected in series:
- **The combined resistance of the components is equal to the sum of individual resistances**

To calculate the total resistance of resistors in series:

$$R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ...$$

**Worked Example:** If three resistors of 30 Ω, R₂, and 10 Ω are connected in series with a combined resistance of 60 Ω:
- $60 = 30 + R_2 + 10$
- $R_2 = 60 - 30 - 10 = 20 \, \Omega$

### Resistors in Parallel

When two or more components are connected in parallel:
- **The reciprocal of the combined resistance is the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances**

To calculate the total resistance of resistors in parallel:

$$\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + ...$$

Key points:
- As more resistors are added in parallel, their combined resistance **decreases** and is therefore less than the resistance of the individual components
- If two resistors of equal resistance are connected in parallel, the combined resistance will halve

**Worked Example:** Three resistors with values R, 2R, and R connected in parallel:
$$\frac{1}{R_T} = \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{2R} + \frac{1}{R} = \left(1 + \frac{1}{2} + 1\right)\frac{1}{R} = \frac{5}{2} \times \frac{1}{R}$$

Therefore: $R_T = \frac{2R}{5}$

> **Exam Tip:** The most common mistake in parallel resistor questions is forgetting to find the reciprocal of $R_T$ (i.e., calculating $\frac{1}{R_T}$) instead of $R_T$. Remember:
> - The reciprocal of a value is $\frac{1}{\text{value}}$
> - To get R from $\frac{1}{R}$, calculate $1 \div \text{your answer}$
> - Use the reciprocal button on your calculator (labelled $x^{-1}$ or $\frac{1}{x}$)

## Series & Parallel Circuits

### Current

- In a **series** circuit, the current is the **same** for all components
- In a **parallel** circuit, the current is split across the different branches (or junctions). The total current into a junction must equal the total current out of a junction
  - The amount of current in each branch depends on the total resistance of the components within that branch

### Potential Difference

- In a **series** circuit, the e.m.f of the power supply is shared amongst all the components in different amounts, depending on their resistance
- In a **parallel** circuit, the voltage of all the components in each branch is equal to the e.m.f of the power supply

### Cells in Series and Parallel

- Cells can be connected in series or parallel
- If cells are connected in **series**, the total voltage between the ends of the chain of cells is the sum of the potential difference across each cell
- If cells are connected in **parallel**, the total voltage across the arrangement is the same as for one cell

### Summary Table

| Property | Series | Parallel |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Voltage** | $V_{in} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3$ | $V_{in} = V_1 = V_2 = V_3$ |
| **Current** | $I_{in} = I_1 = I_2 = I_3$ | $I_{in} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3$ |
| **Resistance** | $R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3$ | $\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}$ |

## Conservation of Charge & Energy

### Conservation of Charge (Kirchhoff's First Law)

**Charge is never used up or lost in a circuit** - this is known as conservation of charge.

As a result of this, for current in a parallel circuit:
- **The sum of the currents entering a junction always equals the sum of the currents out of the junction**

This is known as **Kirchhoff's First Law**.

In a circuit:
- A **junction** is a point where at least three circuit paths meet
- A **branch** is a path connecting two junctions

$$I = I_1 + I_2 + I_3$$

where $I$ represents the current before the circuit splits, and $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$ represent the currents in the respective branches.

Key points:
- The charge is conserved on both sides of the junction
- In a series circuit, the current is the same through all components
- In a parallel circuit, the current divides at the junctions and each branch has a different value

### Conservation of Energy (Kirchhoff's Second Law)

**Energy is never used up or lost in a circuit** - this is known as conservation of energy.

As a result of this, for voltage in any circuit:
- **The total e.m.f. in a closed circuit equals the sum of the potential differences across each component**

This is known as **Kirchhoff's Second Law**.

$$\sum \varepsilon = \sum V$$
$$E_1 + E_2 = V_1 + V_2$$

Key points:
- Each closed circuit can be treated like a series circuit
- In a **series** circuit, the voltage is split across all components depending on their resistance
  - The sum of the voltages equals the total e.m.f of the power supply
- In a **parallel** circuit, the voltage is the same across each closed loop
  - The sum of the voltages **in each closed circuit loop** is equal to the total e.m.f of the power supply
- A closed-circuit loop acts as its own independent series circuit
- A parallel circuit is made up of two or more of these loops

**Practical Application:** This makes parallel circuits incredibly useful for home wiring systems:
- A single power source supplies all lights and appliances with the same voltage
- If one light breaks, voltage and current can still flow through for the rest of the lights and appliances

> **Exam Tip:** Common mistakes to avoid:
> - Thinking the current is the same through every branch in a parallel circuit
> - Thinking the voltage is the same through all components in a series circuit
> - Not taking into account multiple resistors
> - Not calculating total resistance using the appropriate parallel or series equation
> - The sum of voltages in a series circuit not adding up to the e.m.f of the supply
> - The current into a junction not being equal to the current out of a junction
> 
> **Tip:** Don't be afraid to annotate circuit diagrams to help with this. The more information you have about all the components, the easier it is to calculate missing values.

## Electrical Energy & Power

### Energy & Power

In mechanics, power $P$ is defined as the **rate of doing work**:
- The potential difference is the **work done per unit charge**
- Current is the **rate of flow of charge**

Therefore, electrical power is defined as the **rate of change of work done**:

$$P = \frac{E}{t} = \frac{W}{t}$$

where:
- $P$ = power (W)
- $E$ = energy (J)
- $W$ = work done (J)
- $t$ = time (s)

The work done is the energy transferred, so power is the **energy transferred per second** in an electrical component.

The power dissipated by an electrical device can also be written as:

$$P = IV$$

where:
- $P$ = power (W)
- $I$ = current (A)
- $V$ = potential difference / voltage (V)

### Power in Terms of Resistance

Using Ohm's Law ($V = IR$) to rearrange for either $V$ or $I$ and substituting into the power equation, power can be written in terms of resistance $R$:

$$P = I^2R$$

$$P = \frac{V^2}{R}$$

**Important:** For a given resistor, if the current or voltage **doubles**, the power will be **four times** as great.

Which equation to use depends on whether the value of current or voltage has been given in the question.

### Energy Transferred

Rearranging the energy and power equation, the energy can be written as:

$$E = VIt$$

where:
- $E$ = energy transferred (J)
- $V$ = voltage (V)
- $I$ = current (A)
- $t$ = time (s)

> **Exam Tip:** You can use the mnemonic "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Power equals I squared R" to remember whether to multiply or divide by resistance in the power equations. When doing calculations involving electrical power, remember the unit is Watts (W), therefore you should **always** make sure that the time is in **seconds**.

## Potential Divider Circuits

### Potential Divider Circuit

When two resistors are connected in series, through Kirchhoff's Second Law, the potential difference across the power source is divided between them.

**Potential dividers** are circuits which produce an output voltage as a **fraction** of its input voltage.

Potential dividers have three main purposes:
1. To provide a variable potential difference
2. To enable a specific potential difference to be chosen
3. To split the potential difference of a power source between two or more components

Potential dividers are used widely in **volume controls** and **sensory circuits** using LDRs and thermistors.

### The Potential Divider Equation

Potential divider circuits are based on the ratio of voltage between components. This is equal to the ratio of the resistances of the resistors:

$$V_{out} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \times V_{in}$$

Or equivalently:

$$V_{out} = \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} \times V_{in}$$

where:
- $V_{out}$ = output potential difference (V)
- $V_{in}$ = input potential difference (V)
- The **numerator** must be the resistance of the resistor over which $V_{out}$ is measured

Key points:
- The input voltage $V_{in}$ is applied to the top and bottom of the series resistors
- The output voltage $V_{out}$ is measured from the centre to the bottom of the lower resistor
- The potential difference $V$ across each resistor depends upon its resistance $R$:
  - The resistor with the **largest resistance** will have a **greater potential difference** than the other one (from $V = IR$)
  - If the resistance of one resistor is increased, it will get a greater share of the potential difference, whilst the other resistor will get a smaller share
- In potential divider circuits, the p.d across a component is **proportional** to its resistance (from $V = IR$)

> **Exam Tip:** Always make sure the correct resistance is in the numerator of the potential divider equation. This will be the resistance of the component you want to find the output voltage of.

### Variable Resistance Components

Variable and sensory resistors are used in potential dividers to vary the output voltage. This could cause an external component to switch on or off (e.g., a heater switching off automatically when its surroundings are at room temperature).

Sensory resistors used are **Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs)** and **thermistors**.

#### LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- The resistance of an LDR varies with light intensity
- The **higher** the light intensity, the **lower** the resistance (and vice versa)
- An LDR circuit is often used for street lights and security lights

#### Thermistor
- The resistance of a thermistor varies with temperature
- The **hotter** the thermistor, the **lower** the resistance (and vice versa)
- A thermistor circuit is used in fire alarms, ovens, and digital thermometers

### Effect on Output Voltage

From Ohm's law ($V = IR$), the potential difference $V_{out}$ from a resistor in a potential divider circuit is proportional to its resistance:
- If an LDR or thermistor's resistance **decreases**, the potential difference through it also **decreases**
- If an LDR or thermistor's resistance **increases**, the potential difference through it also **increases**

Since the total p.d of the components must equal $V_{in}$:
- If the p.d of the sensory resistor **decreases**, then the p.d of the other resistor in the circuit must **increase** (and vice versa)
