# 5.4 Electromotive Force & Internal Resistance

## Electromotive Force (e.m.f.)

When charge passes through a power supply such as a battery, it **gains** electrical energy.

### Definition

**Electromotive force (e.m.f.)** is defined as:

> The amount of chemical energy converted to electrical energy per coulomb of charge (C) when passing through a power supply

This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$\varepsilon = \frac{E}{Q}$$

Where:
- $\varepsilon$ = e.m.f. (V)
- $E$ = energy transferred (J)
- $Q$ = charge (C)

### Key Points

- E.m.f. is represented by the symbol **ε** (Greek letter epsilon)
- Despite its name, e.m.f. is **not actually a force** — it is measured in **volts (V)**
- E.m.f. is equal to the potential difference across the cell **when no current is flowing**
- E.m.f. can be measured by connecting a **high-resistance voltmeter** around the terminals of the cell in an **open circuit**
- E.m.f. can be defined as the **total** or **maximum** voltage available to the circuit

---

## Terminal Potential Difference

The **terminal potential difference (p.d.)** is the potential difference across the terminals of a cell.

$$V = IR$$

Where:
- $V$ = terminal p.d. (V)
- $I$ = current (A)
- $R$ = resistance (Ω)

Since a cell has internal resistance, the terminal p.d. is always **lower** than the e.m.f.

If there was no internal resistance, the terminal p.d. would be equal to the e.m.f.

---

## Lost Volts

In a closed circuit, current flows through a cell and a potential difference develops across the internal resistance. Since resistance opposes current, this reduces the energy per unit charge (voltage) available to the rest of the external circuit.

This difference is called **lost volts**, usually represented by lowercase **v**.

### Definition

**Lost volts** is defined as:

> The work done per unit charge / coulomb to overcome the internal resistance / resistance inside the battery (when current flows)

In other words, this is the voltage lost in the cell due to internal resistance.

From conservation of energy:

$$v = \varepsilon - V = Ir$$

Where:
- $v$ = lost volts (V)
- $\varepsilon$ = e.m.f. (V)
- $V$ = terminal p.d. (V)
- $I$ = current (A)
- $r$ = internal resistance of the battery (Ω)

---

## Internal Resistance

All power supplies have some resistance between their terminals. This is called **internal resistance (r)**.

### Definition

**Internal resistance** is defined as:

> The resistance of the materials within the battery

### Effects of Internal Resistance

- It is internal resistance that causes the charge circulating to dissipate some electrical energy from the power supply itself
- This is why the cell becomes **warm** after a period of time
- Over time, the internal resistance causes **loss of voltage** or energy loss in a power supply

### Circuit Model

A cell can be thought of as a source of e.m.f. with an internal resistance connected in series:

- $R$ = load resistor (external resistance)
- $r$ = internal resistance
- $\varepsilon$ = e.m.f.
- $V_r$ = lost volts (p.d. across internal resistance)
- $V_R$ = terminal p.d. (p.d. across the load resistor)

---

## The E.M.F. Equation

The e.m.f. is the sum of the potential differences in the circuit:

$$\varepsilon = IR + Ir = I(R + r)$$

This can also be written as:

$$\varepsilon = V + Ir$$

Where:
- $\varepsilon$ = e.m.f. (V)
- $I$ = current (A)
- $R$ = resistance of the load / external circuit (Ω)
- $r$ = internal resistance (Ω)
- $V$ = terminal p.d. (V)

Rearranging for current:

$$I = \frac{\varepsilon}{R + r}$$

---

## Worked Example

**A battery of e.m.f. 7.3 V and internal resistance r of 0.3 Ω is connected in series with a resistor of resistance 9.5 Ω.**

**Determine:**
**(a) The current in the circuit**
**(b) Lost volts from the battery**

### Solution

**(a) Finding the current:**

Using the e.m.f. equation:
$$\varepsilon = I(R + r)$$

Rearranging for $I$:
$$I = \frac{\varepsilon}{R + r}$$

Substituting values:
$$I = \frac{7.3}{9.5 + 0.3} = \frac{7.3}{9.8} = 0.745... = 0.7 \text{ A (2 s.f.)}$$

**(b) Finding the lost volts:**

The lost volts is the voltage lost due to internal resistance:
$$\text{Lost volts} = Ir$$

Substituting values:
$$\text{Lost volts} = 0.7 \times 0.3 = 0.21 = 0.2 \text{ V (2 s.f.)}$$

## Required Practical: Investigating EMF & Internal Resistance

### Aims of the Experiment

To investigate the relationship between e.m.f. and internal resistance by measuring the variation of current and voltage using a variable resistor.

**Variables:**
- **Independent variable:** Resistance, $R$ (Ω)
- **Dependent variables:** Voltage, $V$ (V) and current, $I$ (A)
- **Control variables:** E.m.f. of the cell, internal resistance of the cell

### Equipment List

| Apparatus | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| 1.5 V Cell | To provide an e.m.f. to the circuit |
| Resistor | Unknown resistance — to act as internal resistance |
| 100 Ω Variable Resistor | To change the values of current and voltage in the circuit |
| Voltmeter | 0–2 V range — to measure voltage |
| Ammeter | 0–200 mA range — to measure current |
| Wires | At least 6 leads — to make electrical connections |
| Switch | To open between readings to not run down the battery |

**Resolution of measuring equipment:**
- Voltmeter = 1 mV
- Ammeter = 0.1 mA

### Method

1. The cell and the resistor, labelled r, should be connected in series and considered to be a single cell
2. With the switch open, record the reading $V$ on the voltmeter
3. Set the variable resistor to its maximum value, close the switch and record $V$ and the reading $I$ on the ammeter — **make sure to open the switch between readings**
4. Vary the resistance of the variable resistor up to a minimum of **8–10 readings** and record values for $V$ and $I$ for each resistance. Ensure to take readings for the whole range of the variable resistor

### Analysing the Results

The relationship between e.m.f. and internal resistance is given by:

$$\varepsilon = I(R + r)$$

This can be simplified into the form:
$$\varepsilon = IR + Ir = V + Ir$$

Rearranging for $V$:
$$V = -rI + \varepsilon$$

Comparing this to the equation of a straight line $y = mx + c$:
- $y = V$ (V)
- $x = I$ (A)
- **Gradient** $= -r$ (Ω)
- **Y-intercept** $= \varepsilon$ (V)

### Graph Analysis

1. Plot a graph of $V$ against $I$ and draw a line of best fit
2. Measure the gradient of the graph and compare it with the manufacturer's value of the resistor
3. The y-intercept will be the **e.m.f.** and the gradient will be the **negative internal resistance**

### Evaluating the Experiment

**Systematic Errors:**
- Only close the switch for as long as it takes to take each pair of readings
  - This will prevent the internal resistance of the battery or cell from changing during the experiment

**Random Errors:**
- Only use fairly new cells otherwise the e.m.f. and internal resistance of run-down batteries can vary during the experiment
- Wait for the reading on the voltmeter and ammeter to stabilise (stop fluctuating) before recording the values
- Take multiple repeat readings (at least 3) for each voltage and current and calculate a mean to reduce random errors

### Safety Considerations

- This is a very safe experiment, however, electrical components can get hot when used for a long period
- Switch off the power supply right away if you smell burning
- Make sure there are no liquids close to the equipment, as this could damage the electrical equipment

## Worked Example: Graphical Analysis

**In an experiment, a student uses a variable resistor as an external load. The current flowing through the circuit is measured with a suitable milliammeter and the potential difference across the variable resistor is measured with a voltmeter for a range of resistance values.**

| V / V | I / mA |
|-------|--------|
| 1.60 | 0.0 |
| 1.30 | 13.1 |
| 1.14 | 20.0 |
| 0.96 | 28.2 |
| 0.80 | 35.2 |
| 0.65 | 41.5 |
| 0.49 | 48.8 |
| 0.38 | 53.4 |
| 0.23 | 60.3 |
| 0.10 | 66.0 |

**Determine the e.m.f. and internal resistance directly from the graph.**

### Solution

**Step 1:** Plot the data on a graph of $V$ against $I$ and draw a line of best fit

**Step 2:** Calculate the gradient using the largest triangle possible:

$$\text{Gradient} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{1.6 - 0.1}{0 - 66 \times 10^{-3}} = \frac{1.5}{-0.066} = -22.7 \text{ Ω (3 s.f.)}$$

**Step 3:** Determine the e.m.f. and internal resistance from the graph

From the equation $V = -rI + \varepsilon$:
- Gradient $= -r$ (Ω)
- Y-intercept $= \varepsilon$ (V)

**Therefore:**
- **Internal resistance, $r$ = 22.7 Ω**
- **E.m.f., $\varepsilon$ = 1.60 V**

## Exam Tips

- If the exam question states **'a battery of negligible internal resistance'**, this assumes that e.m.f. of the battery is equal to its voltage. Internal resistance calculations will not be needed here.
- If the battery in the circuit diagram includes internal resistance, then the e.m.f. equations must be used.
- When plotting $V$ against $I$:
  - The **y-intercept** gives the e.m.f. ($\varepsilon$)
  - The **gradient** gives the negative internal resistance ($-r$)
