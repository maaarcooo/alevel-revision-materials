# 4.1 Scalars & Vectors

## Scalars and Vectors

All physical quantities can be classified as either a **scalar** or a **vector**.

**Scalars** are quantities that have **magnitude** only.
- Example: Mass has magnitude but no direction.

**Vectors** are quantities that have both **magnitude** and **direction**.
- Example: Weight is a vector because it is a force with both magnitude and direction.

## Distance and Displacement

**Distance** is a measure of how far an object has travelled, **regardless of direction**.
- It is the total length of the path taken.
- Distance is a **scalar** quantity.

**Displacement** is a measure of how far it is between two points in space, **including the direction**.
- It is the length and direction of a **straight line** drawn from the starting point to the finishing point.
- Displacement is a **vector** quantity.

## Speed and Velocity

**Speed** is a measure of the **distance** travelled per unit time, **regardless of direction**.
- Speed is a **scalar** quantity.

**Velocity** is a measure of the **displacement** per unit time, **including the direction**.
- An object can have a **constant speed** but a **changing velocity** if it is changing direction.
- Velocity is a **vector** quantity.

## Combining Vectors

Vectors are represented by arrows:
- The **arrowhead** indicates the **direction**
- The **length** of the arrow represents the **magnitude**

Vectors can be combined by **adding** them to produce the **resultant vector** (also called the 'net' vector).

### Methods for Adding Vectors

1. **Calculation** — if the vectors are perpendicular
2. **Scale drawing** — if the vectors are not perpendicular

### Vector Calculation (Perpendicular Vectors)

When two vectors are at **right angles**, the resultant is found using:

**Magnitude:** Use **Pythagoras' theorem**

$$R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$

**Direction:** Use **trigonometry**

$$\tan\theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$$

### Scale Drawing Method

1. Link the vectors **head-to-tail**
2. Draw the resultant vector using the **triangle** or **parallelogram method**
3. Measure the length of the resultant vector using a ruler
4. Measure the angle using a protractor
5. Convert back to the required units using the scale

### Triangle Method
1. Link vectors **head-to-tail**
2. The resultant vector connects the tail of the first vector to the head of the second vector

### Parallelogram Method
1. Link vectors **tail-to-tail**
2. Complete the parallelogram
3. The resultant vector is the **diagonal** of the parallelogram

### Vector Subtraction

To subtract vector **b** from vector **a** (i.e., find **a − b**):
1. Reverse the direction of vector **b** to make **−b**
2. Add **a** and **−b** using the triangle or parallelogram method

## Resolving Vectors

**Resolving** a vector is the opposite of adding vectors — a single resultant vector is broken down into its **components**.

For a vector **F** at angle **θ** to the horizontal:

**Horizontal component:**
$$F_x = F\cos\theta$$

**Vertical component:**
$$F_y = F\sin\theta$$

## Forces on an Inclined Plane

For an object on a slope at angle **θ** to the horizontal:

The **weight** (W = mg) can be resolved into:
- **Perpendicular to slope:** $W\cos\theta$ (or $mg\cos\theta$)
- **Parallel to slope:** $W\sin\theta$ (or $mg\sin\theta$)

The **normal reaction force** R acts perpendicular to the slope surface.

If there is no friction:
- The component $W\sin\theta$ causes the object to accelerate down the slope
- The normal force $R = W\cos\theta$ (since there is no motion perpendicular to the slope)

---

## Equilibrium

Forces are in **equilibrium** if an object is either:
- At rest, or
- Moving at **constant velocity**

When coplanar forces are in equilibrium, they form a **closed vector triangle** (the vectors, when joined head-to-tail, form a closed path).

Common forces acting on objects:
- Weight
- Normal reaction force
- Tension (from cords and strings)
- Friction

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Resultant Displacement
A hiker walks 6 km due east and 10 km due north. Find the magnitude and direction of their displacement.

**Magnitude:**
$$R = \sqrt{6^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{36 + 100} = \sqrt{136} = 11.7 \text{ km}$$

**Direction:**
$$\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{10}{6}\right) = 59° \text{ from the horizontal (east)}$$

### Example 2: Resolving Forces
A helicopter provides a lift of 250 kN with blades tilted at 15° from the vertical.

**Vertical component:**
$$F_v = 250 \times \cos(15°) = 242 \text{ kN}$$

**Horizontal component:**
$$F_h = 250 \times \sin(15°) = 64.7 \text{ kN}$$

## Exam Tips

- **Pythagoras' theorem** and **trigonometry** are consistently used in vector problems — ensure you are confident with these.
- Remember: $\cos\theta$ is always the **adjacent** side of the angle (the "cos sandwich" — the angle is sandwiched between the hypotenuse and adjacent side).
- For scale drawings, always convert your measured length back to the required units using the given scale.
- In equilibrium problems, ensure vector arrows form a **closed path** when arranged head-to-tail.
