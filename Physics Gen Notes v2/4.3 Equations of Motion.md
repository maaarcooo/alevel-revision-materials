# 4.3 Equations of Motion

## Motion Along a Straight Line

### Scalar and Vector Quantities

**Scalar quantities** have magnitude (size) only:
- **Distance**: the total length between two points
- **Speed**: the total distance travelled per unit of time

**Vector quantities** have both magnitude and direction:
- **Displacement**: the distance of an object from a fixed point in a specified direction
- **Velocity**: the rate of change of displacement of an object
- **Acceleration**: the rate of change of velocity of an object

### Equations for Velocity and Acceleration

$$v = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$$

$$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$$

Where:
- $v$ = velocity (m s⁻¹)
- $a$ = acceleration (m s⁻²)
- $\Delta s$ = change in displacement (m)
- $\Delta v$ = change in velocity (m s⁻¹)
- $\Delta t$ = change in time (s)

### Instantaneous vs Average Speed/Velocity

**Instantaneous speed/velocity**: the speed or velocity of an object at any given point in time
- Found on a displacement-time graph by drawing a **tangent** at the required time and calculating its **gradient**
- A **curved line** on a displacement-time graph indicates acceleration (changing velocity)

**Average speed/velocity**: total distance (or displacement) divided by total time
- Found by dividing total displacement (y-axis) by total time (x-axis)

## Motion Graphs

### Displacement-Time Graph

| Feature | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Gradient** | Velocity |
| **y-intercept** | Initial displacement |
| Straight diagonal line | Constant velocity |
| Positive slope | Motion in positive direction |
| Negative slope | Motion in negative direction |
| Curved line | Acceleration |
| Horizontal line (zero slope) | Object at rest |
| Area under curve | Meaningless |

### Velocity-Time Graph

| Feature | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Gradient** | Acceleration |
| **y-intercept** | Initial velocity |
| Straight line | Uniform acceleration |
| Positive slope | Increasing velocity (acceleration) |
| Negative slope | Decreasing velocity (deceleration) |
| Curved line | Non-uniform acceleration |
| Horizontal line | Constant velocity |
| **Area under curve** | Displacement/distance travelled |

### Acceleration-Time Graph

| Feature | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Slope | Meaningless |
| **y-intercept** | Initial acceleration |
| Horizontal line | Constant acceleration |
| **Area under curve** | Change in velocity |

### Motion of a Bouncing Ball

For a bouncing ball in a uniform gravitational field (ignoring air resistance):
- Acceleration due to gravity is **always constant** and directed downwards
- Velocity direction changes at highest and lowest points

**At maximum height (point A)**:
- Maximum displacement
- Velocity momentarily **zero**
- Velocity changes from positive to negative
- Acceleration $g$ remains constant downwards

**At ground level (point B)**:
- Minimum displacement
- Velocity changes direction instantaneously (negative to positive)
- Speed magnitude remains the same

## SUVAT Equations

The **SUVAT equations** are used for objects moving with **constant acceleration** in a straight line.

### Variables

| Symbol | Quantity | Unit |
|--------|----------|------|
| $s$ | Displacement | m |
| $u$ | Initial velocity | m s⁻¹ |
| $v$ | Final velocity | m s⁻¹ |
| $a$ | Acceleration | m s⁻² |
| $t$ | Time | s |

### The Four SUVAT Equations

$$v = u + at$$

$$s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$

$$s = \frac{(v + u)}{2}t$$

$$v^2 = u^2 + 2as$$

### Key Points

- All variables except time $t$ are **vector quantities** (can be positive or negative)
- **"Starts from rest"** means $u = 0$
- **"Falling due to gravity"** means $a = g = 9.81$ m s⁻²
- Choose a consistent positive direction throughout a problem
- If upwards is positive: $s$ (upward displacement) is positive, $a = -g$

### Problem-Solving Strategy

1. List known variables (s, u, v, a, t)
2. Identify the unknown variable to find
3. Select the equation containing these variables
4. Convert units to SI and substitute values
5. Rearrange and solve

## Projectile Motion

A **projectile** is a particle moving freely (non-powered) under gravity in a two-dimensional plane.

### Key Terminology

- **Time of flight**: total time the projectile is in the air
- **Maximum height**: height where the projectile is momentarily at rest (vertical velocity = 0)
- **Range**: horizontal distance travelled by the projectile

### Horizontal and Vertical Components

The motion can be analysed by separating into **independent** horizontal and vertical components:

| Component | Displacement | Velocity | Acceleration |
|-----------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **Horizontal** | Maximum range at end of motion | **Constant** | **Zero** |
| **Vertical** | Maximum height at top | **Zero at maximum height** | $g = 9.81$ m s⁻² (downwards) |

### Resolving Initial Velocity

For a projectile launched with velocity $u$ at angle $\theta$ to the horizontal:

$$u_x = u \cos\theta \quad \text{(horizontal component)}$$

$$u_y = u \sin\theta \quad \text{(vertical component)}$$

### Derived Equations

**Time of flight** (returning to same level):
$$T = \frac{2u\sin\theta}{g}$$

**Maximum height**:
$$H = \frac{(u\sin\theta)^2}{2g}$$

**Range**:
$$R = \frac{u^2 \sin 2\theta}{g}$$

### Projectile Scenarios

1. **Vertical projection (free fall)**: Consider only vertical motion with $a = g$
2. **Horizontal projection**: Initial vertical velocity = 0; find time from vertical motion, then calculate horizontal distance
3. **Projection at an angle**: Resolve velocity into components; analyse each direction separately

## Drag Forces

**Drag forces** oppose the motion of an object moving through a fluid (gas or liquid).

### Characteristics of Drag Forces

- Always act in the **opposite direction** to motion
- Never speed up an object or start motion
- Slow objects down or maintain constant speed
- Convert kinetic energy into heat and sound
- **Increase with speed** of the object

**Lift** is an upward force perpendicular to fluid flow (e.g., on aircraft wings).

### Air Resistance

Air resistance is a drag force experienced when moving through air.

**Factors affecting air resistance**:
- Speed (higher speed → greater air resistance)
- Cross-sectional area
- Shape (streamlining reduces drag)
- Altitude (lower air density → less resistance)
- Temperature
- Humidity

### Effects on Projectile Motion

Air resistance:
- Decreases the **horizontal component** of velocity
- Reduces both **range** and **maximum height**
- Causes a steeper descent trajectory
- Results in an asymmetric flight path

## Terminal Velocity

When an object falls through a fluid:

1. Initially, **weight > drag force** → object accelerates downwards
2. As velocity increases, **drag force increases**
3. Resultant force and acceleration decrease
4. Eventually, **drag force = weight** → acceleration = 0
5. Object falls at constant **terminal velocity**

### Key Points

- Terminal velocity is the **maximum velocity** an object can achieve in free fall
- At terminal velocity: $F_{drag} = W$ (forces balanced)
- On a velocity-time graph: terminal velocity shown by a **horizontal line** after initial curve
- Objects with greater mass have higher terminal velocity (require greater drag to balance weight)

## Required Practical: Determination of g

### Aim
Calculate the acceleration due to gravity by measuring the time for a ball-bearing to fall through different heights.

### Variables

- **Independent**: Height, $h$
- **Dependent**: Time, $t$
- **Control**: Same ball-bearing, same electromagnet, consistent release position

### Equipment

- Metre ruler (resolution: 1 mm)
- Steel ball-bearing
- Electromagnet
- Two light gates connected to timer
- Tall clamp stand
- Glass tube
- Cushion

### Method

1. Set up electromagnet at top of clamp stand with glass tube below
2. Position light gates at known separation distance $h$
3. Switch on electromagnet and attach ball-bearing
4. Switch off electromagnet to release ball
5. Record time $t$ between light gates triggering
6. Repeat for different heights (5-10 values)
7. Take 3 repeats for each height and calculate mean

### Analysis

Using SUVAT equation: $s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$

Rearranging: $\frac{2h}{t} = gt + 2u$

Comparing to $y = mx + c$:
- Plot $\frac{2h}{t}$ (y-axis) against $t$ (x-axis)
- **Gradient = $g$** (acceleration due to gravity)
- y-intercept = $2u$ (initial velocity)

### Errors

**Systematic errors**:
- Residual magnetism causing delayed release (time recorded too long)

**Random errors**:
- Uncertainty in $h$ from metre ruler precision
- Parallax error when reading heights
- Ball not falling through centre of light gates

### Safety Considerations

- Keep water away from electrical equipment
- Only switch on electromagnet once setup complete
- Use cushion to catch ball-bearing
- Secure clamp stand with G-clamp

## Exam Tips

1. Always check y-axis labels to distinguish displacement-time from velocity-time graphs
2. For SUVAT problems, list all known quantities before selecting an equation
3. Remember: at maximum height of projectile, vertical velocity = 0 (not total velocity)
4. Use $\sin\theta$ for vertical components and $\cos\theta$ for horizontal components
5. Deceleration means negative acceleration (velocity and acceleration in opposite directions)
6. "Negligible air resistance" means no drag forces act on the body
7. When parachutes deploy, skydivers **decelerate** to a lower terminal velocity (they don't move upwards)
