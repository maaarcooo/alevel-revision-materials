# 4.7 Bulk Properties of Solids

## Density

**Density** is the **mass per unit volume** of an object.

$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$

Where:
- $\rho$ = density (kg m⁻³)
- $m$ = mass (kg)
- $V$ = volume (m³)

**Units:**
- If mass is in g and volume in cm³, density is in g cm⁻³
- If mass is in kg and volume in m³, density is in kg m⁻³

**Key points:**
- Objects made from low-density materials typically have lower mass
- Gases are less dense than solids

### Volume Formulae for Common Shapes

| Shape | Volume Formula |
|-------|----------------|
| Sphere | $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ |
| Cube | $V = d^3$ |
| Cylinder | $V = \pi r^2 l$ |
| Rectangular block | $V = l \times w \times h$ |

### Unit Conversions

- Larger to smaller unit: **multiply**
- Smaller to larger unit: **divide**
- For squared/cubic conversions, square/cube the conversion factor:
  - 1 mm³ = 1 × 10⁻⁹ m³
  - 1 cm³ = 1 × 10⁻⁶ m³

## Hooke's Law

When a force is applied to a spring or wire, it **stretches**. A material obeys Hooke's Law if:

> **The extension of the material is directly proportional to the applied force (load) up to the limit of proportionality.**

$$F = k\Delta L$$

Where:
- $F$ = force (N)
- $k$ = spring constant (N m⁻¹)
- $\Delta L$ = extension (m)

**Spring constant ($k$):**
- Measures the **stiffness** of a material
- Larger spring constant = stiffer material
- Equal to the **gradient** of a force-extension graph (in the linear region)

**Extension:**
$$\text{extension} = \text{stretched length} - \text{unstretched length}$$

Hooke's Law applies to both **extensions** (increase in length) and **compressions** (decrease in length).

### Force-Extension Graphs

**Key features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Limit of proportionality** | Beyond this point, Hooke's Law no longer applies; extension is no longer proportional to force |
| **Elastic limit** | Beyond this point, the material will not return to its original length when unloaded |
| **Gradient** | In the linear region: gradient = $k$ (spring constant) |

**Important:** If the graph has extension on the y-axis and force on the x-axis, the gradient equals $\frac{1}{k}$, not $k$.

## Stress and Strain

### Tensile Stress

**Tensile stress** is the **force exerted per unit cross-sectional area** of a material.

$$\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$$

Where:
- $\sigma$ = tensile stress (Pa)
- $F$ = force applied (N)
- $A$ = cross-sectional area (m²)

**Ultimate tensile stress (UTS):** The maximum force per original cross-sectional area a material can support before breaking.

### Tensile Strain

**Tensile strain** is the **extension per unit length**.

$$\text{strain} = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$$

Where:
- $\Delta L$ = extension (m)
- $L$ = original length (m)

**Key points:**
- Strain is **dimensionless** (ratio of lengths)
- Can be expressed as a percentage: strain × 100%
- Units must be consistent (both in same unit), but don't need to be metres

### Stress-Strain Curves

Stress-strain curves describe material properties including whether they are **brittle** or **ductile**.

**Key points on stress-strain graphs:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Limit of proportionality** | End of Hooke's Law region |
| **Elastic limit** | Beyond this, permanent deformation occurs |
| **Yield stress** | Stress at which material extends plastically for little/no increase in stress |
| **Ultimate tensile stress** | Maximum stress the material can withstand |
| **Breaking point/stress** | Maximum stress before fracture |
| **Elastic region** | Material returns to original shape when force removed |
| **Plastic region** | Material permanently deformed; will not return to original shape |

**Area under the graph:** In the Hooke's Law region, the area represents **elastic strain energy stored per unit volume**.

---

## Elastic Strain Energy

Work must be done to stretch a material. Before the elastic limit, all work done is stored as **elastic strain energy**.

**Elastic strain energy = area under the force-extension graph**

For materials obeying Hooke's Law:

$$E = \frac{1}{2}F\Delta L$$

Or, substituting $F = k\Delta L$:

$$E = \frac{1}{2}k(\Delta L)^2$$

Where:
- $E$ = elastic strain energy (J)
- $F$ = force (N)
- $\Delta L$ = extension (m)
- $k$ = spring constant (N m⁻¹)

### Breaking Stress

- **Breaking stress:** Maximum stress a material can withstand before fracture
- Materials with high breaking stress are **ductile** (extend significantly before breaking due to plastic deformation)
- Example: Copper is ductile, making it suitable for wires

The UTS and breaking stress depend on material conditions such as **temperature**.

### Spring Energy Conversions

A vertical mass-spring system converts between:
- **Elastic potential energy (EPE)**
- **Kinetic energy (KE)**
- **Gravitational potential energy (GPE)**

| Position | EPE | KE | GPE |
|----------|-----|----|----|
| Highest point (compressed spring) | Some | Zero (stationary) | **Maximum** |
| Equilibrium position | Some | **Maximum** (max speed) | Some |
| Lowest point (max extension) | **Maximum** | Zero (stationary) | Minimum |

For horizontal mass-spring systems, only EPE and KE are involved (no GPE changes).

## Elastic and Plastic Behaviour

### Types of Deformation

| Type | Description | Graph Region |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Elastic deformation** | Material returns to original shape when load removed | Below elastic limit |
| **Plastic deformation** | Material permanently deformed; does not return to original shape | Beyond elastic limit |

### Brittle and Ductile Materials

| Material Type | Characteristics | Examples | Graph Shape |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| **Brittle** | Little/no plastic region; breaks with minimal deformation | Glass, concrete, ceramics | Straight line, sudden fracture |
| **Ductile** | Large plastic region; stretches significantly before breaking | Copper, rubber | Straight line then curves toward x-axis |

## Energy Conservation in Deformation

### Loading and Unloading a Metal Wire

When a wire is stretched beyond its limit of proportionality and then unloaded:
- The **unloading line is parallel** to the loading line (same gradient, same $k$)
- The unloading line **does not pass through the origin** (permanent extension)
- **Area between loading and unloading curves** = work done to permanently deform the wire

### Loading and Unloading a Rubber Band

For rubber bands:
- **No permanent extension** when fully unloaded (elastic behaviour)
- Unloading curve lies **below** the loading curve
- Loading stores more strain energy than unloading releases

**Areas under the graph:**
- **Area X** (between curves) = work done heating the rubber (thermal energy)
- **Area Y** (under unloading curve) = work done by rubber returning to original shape
- **Area X + Y** = total work done stretching the rubber

Energy difference is transferred as **heat** (rubber becomes warm when repeatedly stretched and released).

### Vehicle Suspension Systems

**Components:** Tyres, springs, and **shock absorbers**

**Purpose:**
- Absorb impact forces from road irregularities
- Maintain tyre contact with road
- Provide passenger comfort

**How shock absorbers work:**
- Dampen the compression and rebound of suspension springs
- Convert **kinetic energy** into **thermal energy** (dissipated as heat)
- Resistance increases with speed of spring movement

## Exam Tips

1. **Check graph axes** before calculating spring constant from gradient
2. **Strain is dimensionless** - extension and original length must have same units
3. Describe plastic deformation as "**permanently deformed**" rather than "does not obey Hooke's Law"
4. Graph readings may have acceptable ranges in mark schemes (e.g., ±5 MPa for identifying elastic limit)
5. For unit conversions, remember to **cube or square** the conversion factor for volume and area units
