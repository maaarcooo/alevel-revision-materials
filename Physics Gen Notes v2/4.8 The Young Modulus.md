# 4.8 The Young Modulus

## Definition and Concept

The **Young modulus** is the measure of the ability of a material to withstand changes in length with an added load. It provides information about the **stiffness** of a material, which is essential for engineers when selecting materials that must withstand sufficient forces.

The Young Modulus is defined as the **ratio of tensile stress and tensile strain**:

$$E = \frac{\text{Tensile stress}}{\text{Tensile strain}} = \frac{FL}{A\Delta L}$$

Where:
- $F$ = force (N)
- $L$ = original length (m)
- $A$ = cross-sectional area (m²)
- $\Delta L$ = extension (m)

## Units

Since strain is **dimensionless** (a ratio of two lengths), the units of Young Modulus are **pascals (Pa)**.

The Young Modulus of a material is typically a very large number, in the order of **GPa** (gigapascals).

## Typical Values for Common Materials

| Material   | Young's Modulus / GPa |
|------------|----------------------|
| Aluminium  | 70                   |
| Copper     | 117                  |
| Brass      | 120                  |
| Iron       | 170                  |
| Nickel     | 210                  |
| Steel      | 110                  |

## Young Modulus from Stress-Strain Graphs

The Young Modulus equals the **gradient** of a stress-strain graph when it is linear (a straight line). This linear region is where **Hooke's Law is obeyed**.

The **area under the graph** in this linear region equals the **energy stored per unit volume** of the material.

### Calculating Young Modulus from a Graph

1. Identify the linear region of the stress-strain graph
2. Determine the stress and strain values at a point within this region
3. Calculate the gradient: $E = \frac{\Delta \sigma}{\Delta \varepsilon}$

## Required Practical: Measuring the Young Modulus

### Aim

To measure the Young Modulus of a metal in the form of a wire using a clamped horizontal wire over a pulley (or alternatively, a vertical wire attached to the ceiling with a mass attached).

### Variables

- **Independent variable**: Force (or load) (N)
- **Dependent variable**: Extension (m)
- **Control variables**: Original length of wire, thickness of wire, metal used for the wire

### Equipment

| Equipment | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Bench | To hold the equipment |
| G-clamp | To stabilise the apparatus |
| Copper wire | To calculate the Young modulus of copper |
| Metre ruler | To measure the length of the wire and extension |
| Pulley | To allow the mass to hang vertically, reduces friction |
| Tape marker | To accurately measure the extension with the applied load |
| Wooden blocks | Clamps together the wire to keep it taut and straight |
| Mass hanger + 100 g masses | To hang from the pulley and add load to the wire |
| Micrometer | To measure the diameter of the wire |

**Resolution of measuring equipment:**
- Metre ruler = 1 mm
- Micrometer = 0.001 mm

### Method

1. Measure the diameter of the wire with a micrometer screw gauge or digital callipers. Take at least 3 readings and find an average.
2. Set up the apparatus so the wire is taut. No masses should be on the mass hanger yet.
3. Measure the original length of the wire using a metre ruler and mark a reference point with tape (preferably near the beginning of the scale, e.g. at 1 cm).
4. Record the initial reading on the ruler of the reference point.
5. Add a 100 g mass onto the mass hanger.
6. Read and record the new reading of the tape marker from the metre ruler.
7. Repeat by adding a 100 g mass (at least 5–10 times) and record the new scale reading each time.

### Analysis of Results

The Young modulus is found from:

$$E = \frac{FL}{A\Delta L}$$

Rearranging for force:

$$F = \left(\frac{E \times A}{L}\right) \Delta L$$

Comparing to $y = mx$:
- $y = F$
- $x = \Delta L$
- Gradient = $(E \times A) / L$

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate the cross-sectional area** of the wire:
$$A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}$$
where $d$ = diameter of the wire (m)

2. **Plot a graph** of load (force) against extension
   - Load is found by multiplying each mass by $g$ (9.81 N kg⁻¹)

3. **Determine the gradient** of this graph
   - $F/\Delta L$ is the gradient of the force-extension graph

4. **Calculate the Young Modulus**:
$$E = \text{gradient} \times \frac{L}{A}$$

### Evaluating the Experiment

**Systematic Errors:**
- Use a vernier scale for more precise readings, producing a more accurate value for the extension
- If the wire is extended past its elastic limit, it will be permanently deformed
  - To reduce this risk, remove the load and check the wire returns to its original length before taking any new readings

**Random Errors:**
- Parallax error from reading the marker on the ruler
- Reduce random errors by repeating the experiment for all loads and finding an average extension
- Reduce uncertainty on cross-sectional area by measuring the diameter in several places and calculating an average

### Safety Considerations

- Wear **safety goggles** at all times in case the wire snaps
- Place a **cushion or soft surface** directly below the mass hanger in case it falls off

## Worked Example

**Question:** A metal wire supported vertically from a fixed point has a load of 92 N applied to the lower end. The wire has a cross-sectional area of 0.04 mm² and obeys Hooke's law. The length of the wire increases by 0.50%. What is the Young modulus of the metal wire?

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Write the Young Modulus equation
$$E = \frac{\text{Stress}}{\text{Strain}} = \frac{FL}{A\Delta L}$$

**Step 2:** Calculate stress
$$\text{Stress} = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{92}{0.04 \times 10^{-6}} = 2.3 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa}$$

*Note: 1 mm² = 1 × 10⁻⁶ m²*

**Step 3:** Calculate strain
$$\text{Strain} = \frac{\Delta L}{L} = 0.50\% = 0.005$$

**Step 4:** Calculate Young Modulus
$$E = \frac{2.3 \times 10^9}{0.005} = 4.6 \times 10^{11} \text{ Pa}$$

## Exam Tips

- **Memory aid:** To remember the order in the Young modulus equation, think: "When you're stressed, you show the strain" (i.e., Stress ÷ Strain)
- When reading stress-strain graphs, ensure you identify the **linear region** correctly before calculating the gradient
- Always convert units properly: mm² to m² requires multiplying by 10⁻⁶
- For the practical, suggest improvements such as: repeat readings, use a longer length of wire, use more precise measuring instruments
