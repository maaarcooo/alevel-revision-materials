# 1.2 Limitation of Physical Measurements

## Errors and Uncertainty

### True Value and Uncertainty

- **True value**: The actual value of a quantity that measurements aim to find
- **Uncertainty**: An estimate of the difference between a measurement reading and the true value; a range within which the true value is expected to lie

**Key distinction:**
- **Errors** = problems with equipment/methodology causing readings to differ from true value
- **Uncertainty** = quantified range around a measurement

### Random Errors

**Random errors** cause unpredictable fluctuations in readings (sometimes too high, sometimes too low). They affect **precision**.

**Causes:**
- Natural variations in measurements
- Human reaction timing errors
- Fluctuating instrument readings

**Reduction methods:**
- Repeat measurements and calculate mean
- Use more precise instruments

### Systematic Errors

**Systematic errors** arise from faulty instruments or flawed methods. The error is consistent and repeated every time.

**Causes:**
- Faulty/incorrectly calibrated instruments
- Parallax error when reading scales
- Background radiation in radioactivity experiments

**Reduction methods:**
- Recalibrate instruments or use different ones
- Correct/adjust experimental technique

### Zero Error

A **zero error** occurs when an instrument gives a non-zero reading when the true value is zero. This introduces a fixed error that must be accounted for in all results.

## Precision and Accuracy

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Precision** | Little spread about the mean value (regardless of closeness to true value). More decimal places = more precise. |
| **Accuracy** | How close measurements are to the true value. Improved by repeating measurements and finding the mean. |
| **Repeatability** | Same experimenter, same method, same equipment → same results |
| **Resolution** | Smallest detectable change in a quantity that produces a perceptible change in reading |

**Four combinations:**
1. Accurate and precise — clustered at true value
2. Accurate but not precise — scattered around true value
3. Precise but not accurate — clustered but offset from true value
4. Neither accurate nor precise — scattered and offset

## Uncertainty in Measurements

### Types of Uncertainty

**Absolute Uncertainty** — fixed quantity (e.g., 1.6 ± 0.1 mA)

**Fractional Uncertainty:**
$$\text{Fractional uncertainty} = \frac{\text{uncertainty}}{\text{measured value}}$$

**Percentage Uncertainty:**
$$\text{Percentage uncertainty} = \frac{\text{uncertainty}}{\text{measured value}} \times 100\%$$

### Determining Uncertainty

| Situation | Uncertainty |
|-----------|-------------|
| Single reading | ± half the smallest division |
| Repeated readings | ± half the range: $\frac{\text{max} - \text{min}}{2}$ |
| Digital instrument | ± the last significant digit |
| Manufacturer specification | As stated |

## Combining Uncertainties

| Operation | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Adding/Subtracting** | Add the **absolute** uncertainties |
| **Multiplying/Dividing** | Add the **percentage** (or fractional) uncertainties |
| **Raising to a power** | Multiply the percentage uncertainty by the power |

**Example:** For $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, the percentage uncertainty in $V$ is **3 ×** the percentage uncertainty in $r$.

## Uncertainty in Graphs

### Error Bars

- Drawn above/below points (y-uncertainty) or side-to-side (x-uncertainty)
- Show the range within which the true value is expected to lie

### Lines of Best and Worst Fit

1. Draw **line of best fit** through error bars
2. Draw **steepest** and **shallowest** lines through all error bars — these are **lines of worst fit**

### Percentage Uncertainty in Gradient

$$\text{Percentage uncertainty} = \frac{\text{best gradient} - \text{worst gradient}}{\text{best gradient}} \times 100\%$$

### Percentage Uncertainty in Y-Intercept

$$\text{Percentage uncertainty} = \frac{\text{best y-intercept} - \text{worst y-intercept}}{\text{best y-intercept}} \times 100\%$$

## Key Equations Summary

| Quantity | Formula |
|----------|---------|
| Fractional uncertainty | $\dfrac{\Delta x}{x}$ |
| Percentage uncertainty | $\dfrac{\Delta x}{x} \times 100\%$ |
| Uncertainty in repeated readings | $\dfrac{\text{max} - \text{min}}{2}$ |
| % uncertainty in gradient | $\dfrac{\text{best} - \text{worst}}{\text{best}} \times 100\%$ |
