# 2. Particles & Radiation

## 2.1 Constituents of the Atom

An atom consists of a **nucleus** (containing **protons** and **neutrons**, collectively called **nucleons**) surrounded by orbiting **electrons**.

| Particle | Charge (C) | Relative Charge | Mass (kg) | Relative Mass | Specific Charge (C kg⁻¹) |
|----------|------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Proton | $+1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ | +1 | $1.67 \times 10^{-27}$ | 1 | $9.58 \times 10^{7}$ |
| Neutron | 0 | 0 | $1.67 \times 10^{-27}$ | 1 | 0 |
| Electron | $-1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ | -1 | $9.11 \times 10^{-31}$ | 0.0005 | $1.76 \times 10^{11}$ |

**Specific charge** is the charge-to-mass ratio of a particle:

$$\text{Specific charge} = \frac{\text{Charge}}{\text{Mass}}$$

**Proton number (Z)**: Number of protons in the nucleus.

**Nucleon number (A)**: Total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.

Notation: $^{A}_{Z}X$ where X is the element symbol.

**Isotopes**: Atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Example: Carbon-14 is used in **carbon dating** to determine the age of organic materials.

## 2.2 Stable and Unstable Nuclei

### The Strong Nuclear Force (SNF)

The **strong nuclear force** keeps the nucleus stable by overcoming the electrostatic repulsion between protons.

Properties of the SNF:
- Acts only on **nucleons** (not electrons)
- **Attractive** at separations up to **3 fm**
- **Repulsive** at separations below **0.5 fm**
- Very short range

**Unstable nuclei** have an imbalance of protons or neutrons, causing the SNF to be insufficient for stability. These nuclei undergo radioactive decay.

### Alpha Decay (α)

Occurs in **large nuclei** with too many protons and neutrons.

$$^{A}_{Z}X \rightarrow ^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y + ^{4}_{2}\alpha$$

- Proton number decreases by 2
- Nucleon number decreases by 4
- An **alpha particle** (2 protons + 2 neutrons) is emitted

### Beta-Minus Decay (β⁻)

Occurs in **neutron-rich** nuclei.

$$^{A}_{Z}X \rightarrow ^{A}_{Z+1}Y + ^{0}_{-1}\beta + \bar{\nu}_e$$

- A neutron converts to a proton
- An **electron** (β⁻ particle) and an **electron antineutrino** are emitted
- Proton number increases by 1
- Nucleon number stays the same

**Neutrinos** were hypothesised to explain the apparent non-conservation of energy in beta decay, and were later observed experimentally.

### Beta-Plus Decay (β⁺)

Occurs in **proton-rich** nuclei.

$$p \rightarrow n + e^{+} + \nu_e$$

- A proton converts to a neutron
- A **positron** (β⁺ particle) and an **electron neutrino** are emitted

## 2.3 Particles, Antiparticles and Photons

### Antiparticles

Every particle has a corresponding **antiparticle** with:
- Same **mass** and **rest energy**
- **Opposite** charge and quantum numbers

| Particle | Mass (kg) | Rest Energy (MeV) | Charge (C) |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Electron ($e^-$) | $9.11 \times 10^{-31}$ | 0.511 | $-1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ |
| Positron ($e^+$) | $9.11 \times 10^{-31}$ | 0.511 | $+1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ |
| Electron neutrino ($\nu_e$) | ≈0 | 0 | 0 |
| Electron antineutrino ($\bar{\nu}_e$) | ≈0 | 0 | 0 |

### Photons

**Photons** are packets (quanta) of electromagnetic energy with no mass.

$$E = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$

Where $h = 6.63 \times 10^{-34}$ J s (Planck's constant).

### Annihilation

**Annihilation**: A particle and its antiparticle collide and convert their mass into energy, releasing **two photons** travelling in opposite directions (to conserve momentum).

Minimum photon energy = rest energy of particle-antiparticle pair.

Application: **PET scanners** use positron-electron annihilation to produce gamma photons for medical imaging.

### Pair Production

**Pair production**: A high-energy photon converts into a particle-antiparticle pair.

- Photon energy must exceed the combined rest energy of both particles
- Excess energy becomes kinetic energy
- Usually occurs near a nucleus (to conserve momentum)

## 2.4 Particle Interactions

### Fundamental Forces and Exchange Particles

Forces between particles are mediated by **exchange particles** (gauge bosons), which carry energy and momentum.

| Interaction | Exchange Particle | Range (m) | Acts On |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| Strong | Gluon | $3 \times 10^{-15}$ | Hadrons |
| Weak | W⁺ or W⁻ boson | $10^{-18}$ | All particles |
| Electromagnetic | Virtual photon (γ) | Infinite | Charged particles |
| Gravity | Graviton | Infinite | Particles with mass |

### Weak Interaction Processes

The **weak nuclear force** is responsible for:

**Beta-minus decay**: $n \rightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$ (W⁻ boson emitted)

**Beta-plus decay**: $p \rightarrow n + e^+ + \nu_e$ (W⁺ boson emitted)

**Electron capture**: $p + e^- \rightarrow n + \nu_e$ (W⁺ boson exchanged)

**Electron-proton collision**: $p + e^- \rightarrow n + \nu_e$ (W⁻ boson exchanged)

## 2.5 Classification of Particles

### Hadrons vs Leptons

| Property | Hadrons | Leptons |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Structure | Made of **quarks** | **Fundamental** (not made of smaller particles) |
| Strong force | Experience it | Do **not** experience it |
| Examples | Protons, neutrons, pions, kaons | Electrons, muons, neutrinos |

### Hadrons: Baryons and Mesons

**Baryons**: Made of **3 quarks**
- Baryon number = +1
- Examples: proton (uud), neutron (udd)
- The **proton is the only stable baryon**; all baryons eventually decay into protons

**Antibaryons**: Made of **3 antiquarks**
- Baryon number = -1

**Mesons**: Made of a **quark-antiquark pair**
- Baryon number = 0
- Examples: pions (π), kaons (K)
- **Pions** are exchange particles for the strong nuclear force

### Leptons

**Leptons** are fundamental particles:
- Electron ($e^-$) and electron neutrino ($\nu_e$)
- Muon ($\mu^-$) and muon neutrino ($\nu_\mu$)
- Plus their antiparticles

**Muons** are "heavy electrons" that decay into electrons.

### Strange Particles

**Strange particles**: Produced via the **strong interaction** but decay via the **weak interaction**.
- Examples: Kaons (K), which decay into pions
- Always produced in pairs (associated production)

**Strangeness**: A quantum number assigned to particles containing strange quarks.
- Conserved in **strong** interactions
- Can change by 0, +1, or -1 in **weak** interactions

## 2.6 Quarks and Antiquarks

### Quark Properties

| Quark | Symbol | Charge | Baryon Number | Strangeness |
|-------|--------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Up | u | $+\frac{2}{3}e$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ | 0 |
| Down | d | $-\frac{1}{3}e$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ | 0 |
| Strange | s | $-\frac{1}{3}e$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ | -1 |

Antiquarks have **opposite signs** for all properties.

### Quark Compositions

**Baryons**:
- Proton: **uud** (charge: $+\frac{2}{3} + \frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = +1$)
- Neutron: **udd** (charge: $+\frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = 0$)

**Mesons**:

| Particle | Quark Composition | Charge | Strangeness |
|----------|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| π⁰ | $u\bar{u}$ or $d\bar{d}$ | 0 | 0 |
| π⁺ | $u\bar{d}$ | +1 | 0 |
| π⁻ | $\bar{u}d$ | -1 | 0 |
| K⁰ | $d\bar{s}$ or $\bar{d}s$ | 0 | ±1 |
| K⁺ | $u\bar{s}$ | +1 | +1 |
| K⁻ | $\bar{u}s$ | -1 | -1 |

### Beta Decay at Quark Level

**Beta-minus**: A down quark changes to an up quark ($d \rightarrow u$)

**Beta-plus**: An up quark changes to a down quark ($u \rightarrow d$)

## 2.7 Conservation Laws

### Quantities Always Conserved

In all particle interactions:
- **Energy and momentum**
- **Charge**
- **Baryon number**
- **Electron lepton number**
- **Muon lepton number**

### Strangeness

- **Conserved** in strong interactions
- **Not conserved** in weak interactions (can change by 0, ±1)

### Applying Conservation Laws

To verify an interaction is possible, check that all conserved quantities have the same total before and after.

Example — Beta-minus decay: $n \rightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$

| Property | Before | After | Change |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Charge | 0 | +1 - 1 + 0 = 0 | 0 ✓ |
| Baryon number | 1 | 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 | 0 ✓ |
| Electron lepton number | 0 | 0 + 1 - 1 = 0 | 0 ✓ |

## 2.8 The Photoelectric Effect

### The Phenomenon

**Photoelectric effect**: Emission of **photoelectrons** from a metal surface when electromagnetic radiation above a certain frequency is incident on it.

### Key Observations

1. Photoelectrons are emitted **only if** the frequency exceeds the **threshold frequency** ($f_0$)
2. Increasing **intensity** increases the **number** of photoelectrons (not their energy)
3. Increasing **frequency** increases the **maximum kinetic energy** of photoelectrons
4. Emission is **instantaneous** (no time delay)

### Why Wave Theory Fails

Classical wave theory predicts:
- Any frequency should eventually cause emission (given enough time)
- Higher intensity should increase electron energy

This contradicts experimental observations.

### Photon Model Explanation

- EM radiation consists of discrete **photons** with energy $E = hf$
- **One photon** is absorbed by **one electron**
- If $hf < \phi$, no emission occurs regardless of intensity
- If $hf \geq \phi$, electrons are emitted immediately

### Key Definitions

**Work function (φ)**: Minimum energy required to remove an electron from the metal surface.

**Threshold frequency ($f_0$)**: Minimum frequency for photoelectric emission.

$$f_0 = \frac{\phi}{h}$$

**Stopping potential ($V_s$)**: Minimum potential difference to stop the most energetic photoelectrons.

$$E_{k(max)} = eV_s$$

### Photoelectric Equation

$$hf = \phi + E_{k(max)}$$

or

$$E_{k(max)} = hf - \phi$$

## 2.9 Collisions of Electrons with Atoms

### Energy Levels

Electrons in atoms exist in **discrete energy levels**. They cannot exist between levels.

**Ground state**: The lowest energy level an electron can occupy.

### Excitation

**Excitation**: An electron absorbs **exactly** the right amount of energy to move to a higher energy level.

- Energy must match the exact difference between levels
- Can occur via collision with free electrons or absorption of photons
- Excited electrons quickly return to lower levels, emitting photons

### Ionisation

**Ionisation**: An electron gains enough energy to be completely removed from the atom.

- The atom becomes a positive ion
- Requires energy ≥ the **ionisation energy**

### Fluorescent Tubes

1. High voltage accelerates free electrons through mercury vapour
2. Electrons collide with mercury atoms, causing excitation
3. Excited atoms de-excite, emitting **UV photons**
4. UV photons are absorbed by the **fluorescent coating**
5. Coating atoms excite and de-excite, emitting **visible light**

---

## 2.10 Energy Levels and Photon Emission

### Photon Emission

When an electron transitions from a higher energy level ($E_1$) to a lower level ($E_2$):

$$\Delta E = E_1 - E_2 = hf$$

The emitted photon has frequency:

$$f = \frac{E_1 - E_2}{h}$$

### Line Spectra

**Line emission spectrum**: Discrete bright lines on a dark background.
- Each line corresponds to a specific electron transition
- Evidence for **discrete energy levels**

**Line absorption spectrum**: Dark lines on a continuous spectrum.
- Atoms absorb photons matching energy level differences
- Same wavelengths as emission spectrum

### Electron Volt (eV)

**Electron volt (eV)**: Energy gained by one electron accelerated through a potential difference of 1 V.

$$1 \text{ eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$$

Conversions:
- eV to J: multiply by $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$
- J to eV: divide by $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$

## 2.11 Wave-Particle Duality

### Evidence for Duality

**Light as a wave**: Diffraction, interference

**Light as a particle**: Photoelectric effect

**Electrons as waves**: Electron diffraction (produces interference patterns)

**Electron diffraction** provides evidence that particles have wave-like properties.

### De Broglie Wavelength

De Broglie hypothesised that all matter has wave properties.

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{mv} = \frac{h}{p}$$

Where:
- $\lambda$ = de Broglie wavelength
- $h$ = Planck's constant
- $m$ = mass
- $v$ = velocity
- $p$ = momentum

### Effect of Momentum on Diffraction

- **Higher momentum** → shorter wavelength → less diffraction → interference rings closer together
- **Lower momentum** → longer wavelength → more diffraction → interference rings further apart

### Scientific Acceptance

Wave-particle duality was initially controversial but became accepted as experimental evidence accumulated. Scientific knowledge evolves through:
- Gathering experimental evidence
- **Peer review** and validation
- Publication and replication
