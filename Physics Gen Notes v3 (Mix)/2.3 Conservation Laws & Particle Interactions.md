# 2.3 Conservation Laws & Particle Interactions

## The Four Fundamental Interactions

There are **four fundamental interactions** (or fundamental forces):

| Force | Relative Strength | Range | Affects | Exchange Particle |
|-------|------------------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **Strong Nuclear** | Strongest | ~$10^{-15}$ m | Hadrons only | Pion ($\pi^+$, $\pi^-$, $\pi^0$) / Gluon |
| **Electromagnetic** | - | Infinite | Charged particles | Photon ($\gamma$) |
| **Weak Nuclear** | - | Up to $10^{-18}$ m | All particles | W bosons ($W^+$, $W^-$) / Z boson ($Z^0$) |
| **Gravity** | Weakest | Infinite | Particles with mass | Graviton (theoretical) |

**Key points:**
- Gravity is too weak to play a role in particle interactions
- The graviton has not yet been discovered

## Exchange Particles

**Exchange particles** (or **virtual particles**) mediate fundamental forces between particles.

- When two particles exert a force on each other, a **virtual particle** is created
- Virtual particles exist only briefly and carry the fundamental force between particles
- Exchange particles are also called **gauge bosons**

**Analogy:**
- Ball thrown between skateboarders → **repulsion**
- Boomerang thrown between skateboarders → **attraction**

## The Electromagnetic Force

The electromagnetic force acts only between **charged particles**.

**Properties of the photon ($\gamma$):**
- No mass
- No charge
- Its own antiparticle

**Functions:**
- Produces electromagnetic repulsion/attraction between charged particles
- Binds electrons to atoms (attraction between negative electrons and positive nucleus)

## The Strong Nuclear Force

The strong interaction affects **hadrons** (particles made of quarks).

**Exchange particles:**
- **Pion** — between nucleons
- **Gluon** — between quarks

Leptons cannot interact via the strong force since they are not made of quarks.

## The Weak Interaction

The weak interaction is responsible for **radioactive decay** of atoms.

**Exchange particles:** $W^+$, $W^-$, or $Z^0$ bosons (depending on the interaction type)

### Beta-Minus ($\beta^-$) Decay

$$n \rightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$$

- A **neutron** → **proton** + **electron** + **anti-electron neutrino**
- Exchange particle: **$W^-$ boson**
- At quark level: a **down quark** transforms into an **up quark**

$$d \rightarrow u + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$$

### Beta-Plus ($\beta^+$) Decay

$$p \rightarrow n + e^+ + \nu_e$$

- A **proton** → **neutron** + **positron** + **electron neutrino**
- Exchange particle: **$W^+$ boson**
- At quark level: an **up quark** transforms into a **down quark**

$$u \rightarrow d + e^+ + \nu_e$$

**Tip:** The sign of the W boson matches the type of beta decay ($W^-$ for $\beta^-$, $W^+$ for $\beta^+$).

### Electron Capture

$$p + e^- \rightarrow n + \nu_e$$

- An atomic **electron is absorbed by a proton** in the nucleus
- Products: **neutron** + **electron neutrino**
- Exchange particle: **$W^+$ boson** (proton acts on electron)

### Electron–Proton Collision

$$p + e^- \rightarrow n + \nu_e$$

- Same equation as electron capture
- Exchange particle: **$W^-$ boson** (electron acts on proton)

The Feynman diagrams for these two processes differ only in the direction/sign of the W boson.

## Feynman Diagrams

**Feynman diagrams** are visual representations of particle interactions showing the exchange particles involved.

### Rules for Feynman Diagrams

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Axes | y-axis = **time**, x-axis = **space** |
| Vertices | Where particles and exchange particles meet (points of interaction) |
| Particle direction | Incoming particles at **bottom**, outgoing at **top** |
| Particle lines | **Straight lines** with arrows (forward in time) |
| Exchange particles | **Wavy lines** with no arrows |
| Exchange direction | Left to right (unless indicated by arrow above wavy line) |
| Spatial arrangement | Hadrons/quarks on **left**, leptons on **right** (never meet at a vertex) |
| Conservation | Charge, baryon number, and lepton number must be **conserved at each vertex** |
| No crossing | Lines must **not** cross over |

### Common Feynman Diagrams

**Electromagnetic repulsion (e.g., two electrons):**
- Two electrons exchange a **virtual photon** ($\gamma$) and repel

**Beta-minus decay:**
- Neutron → proton via $W^-$ boson
- $W^-$ decays into electron + anti-electron neutrino

**Beta-plus decay:**
- Proton → neutron via $W^+$ boson
- $W^+$ decays into positron + electron neutrino

**Electron capture:**
- Proton absorbs electron via $W^+$ boson → neutron + electron neutrino
- Arrow on $W^+$ points left to right

**Electron–proton collision:**
- Electron collides with proton via $W^-$ boson → neutron + electron neutrino
- Arrow on $W^-$ points right to left

## Application of Conservation Laws

All particle interactions must obey conservation of:

| Quantity | Symbol | Always Conserved? |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Charge** | Q | Yes |
| **Baryon number** | B | Yes |
| **Lepton number** | L | Yes |
| **Strangeness** | S | Yes (except weak interactions: can change by 0, +1, or −1) |
| Energy (mass-energy) | E | Yes |
| Momentum | p | Yes |

**Quantum numbers** (Q, B, L, S) can only take discrete values: 0, +1, −1, ½, etc.

### Checking if an Interaction is Permitted

1. Calculate each quantum number on both sides of the equation
2. If **all quantities are conserved**, the interaction can occur
3. If **any quantity is not conserved** (except S in weak interactions), the interaction **cannot occur**

### Example: Kaon Decay

For $K^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu_\mu$:

| Quantity | LHS | RHS | Conserved? |
|----------|-----|-----|------------|
| Q | +1 | +1 + 0 = +1 | ✓ |
| B | 0 | 0 + 0 = 0 | ✓ |
| L | 0 | −1 + 1 = 0 | ✓ |
| S | +1 | 0 + 0 = 0 | ✗ |

Strangeness is not conserved → must be a **weak interaction**.

### Quark-Level Conservation in Beta Decay

**$\beta^-$ decay:**
- Neutron (udd) → Proton (uud)
- Quark charges: $(+\frac{2}{3}) + (-\frac{1}{3}) + (-\frac{1}{3}) = 0$ → $(+\frac{2}{3}) + (+\frac{2}{3}) + (-\frac{1}{3}) = +1$
- Total charge: $0 = +1 + (-1) + 0$ ✓

**$\beta^+$ decay:**
- Proton (uud) → Neutron (udd)
- Total charge: $+1 = 0 + (+1) + 0$ ✓

## Key Exam Tips

1. **Exchange particles:** Remember which exchange particle mediates each fundamental interaction (essential for Feynman diagrams)

2. **Feynman diagrams:** Always include arrows on particle lines and indicate direction of charged W bosons

3. **Conservation checks:** Quantum numbers for exotic particles will be given; standard particle data is on the datasheet

4. **W boson sign:** $W^-$ for $\beta^-$ decay, $W^+$ for $\beta^+$ decay

5. **Strangeness exception:** Can change by 0, ±1 in weak interactions only
