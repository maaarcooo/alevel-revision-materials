# 2.4 The Photoelectric Effect

## The Electronvolt

The **electronvolt (eV)** is a unit used to express very small energies, since quantum energies are much smaller than 1 joule.

**Definition**: The energy gained by an electron travelling through a potential difference of one volt.

$$1 \text{ eV} = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$$

**Conversions**:
- eV → J: multiply by $1.60 \times 10^{-19}$
- J → eV: divide by $1.60 \times 10^{-19}$

**Derivation**: From potential difference $V = \frac{E}{Q}$, an electron ($Q = 1.60 \times 10^{-19}$ C) through 1 V gains:

$$E = QV = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$$

### Relation to Kinetic Energy

When a charged particle accelerates from rest through potential difference $V$:

$$eV = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

Rearranging for velocity:

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m}}$$

## The Photoelectric Effect

The **photoelectric effect** is the phenomenon where electrons are emitted from a metal surface upon absorption of electromagnetic radiation.

- Electrons emitted this way are called **photoelectrons**
- Provides evidence that light behaves as a particle
- Light is **quantised** — carried in discrete packets (photons)
- Each electron can absorb only **one photon**
- Only frequencies above a **threshold frequency** cause emission

## Threshold Frequency & Wavelength

**Threshold frequency ($f_0$)**: The minimum frequency of incident electromagnetic radiation required to remove a photoelectron from the surface of a metal.

**Threshold wavelength ($\lambda_0$)**: The longest wavelength of incident electromagnetic radiation that would remove a photoelectron from the surface of a metal.

Related by the wave equation:

$$c = f\lambda$$

Threshold frequency and wavelength are **material properties** — they vary between metals.

| Metal | Threshold Frequency ($f_0$) / Hz | Threshold Wavelength ($\lambda_0$) / nm |
|-------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Sodium | $4.40 \times 10^{14}$ | 682 |
| Potassium | $5.56 \times 10^{14}$ | 540 |
| Zinc | $1.02 \times 10^{15}$ | 294 |
| Iron | $1.04 \times 10^{15}$ | 289 |
| Copper | $1.13 \times 10^{15}$ | 266 |
| Gold | $1.23 \times 10^{15}$ | 244 |
| Silver | $9.71 \times 10^{15}$ | 30.9 |

**Alkali metals** (sodium, potassium) have threshold frequencies in the **visible light** region — weaker attractive forces between surface electrons and metal ions.

**Transition metals** (zinc, iron) have threshold frequencies in the **ultraviolet** region — stronger attractive forces.

## The Work Function

**Work function ($\Phi$)**: The minimum energy required to release a photoelectron from the surface of a metal.

- Electrons are trapped in an 'energy well' where the depth equals the work function
- A single electron absorbs one photon
- Electron escapes only if photon energy ≥ $\Phi$
- Different metals have different work functions
- More tightly bound electrons require more energy to escape

---

## Stopping Potential

**Stopping potential ($V_s$)**: The potential difference required to stop photoelectron emission from occurring.

**Experimental setup**:
- **Emitter plate**: Where photons cause photoelectron emission
- **Collector plate**: Where electrons are collected
- Electrons crossing the gap create a **photoelectric current**
- Increasing p.d. opposes electron motion until no electrons cross at $V_s$

**Maximum kinetic energy** of photoelectrons:

$$E_{k(\text{max})} = eV_s$$

### Intensity and Stopping Potential

Increasing **intensity** increases:
- Number of photons incident on the metal
- Number of photoelectrons emitted (**photoelectric current**)

Stopping potential remains **constant** at different intensities — intensity does **not** affect kinetic energy of photoelectrons.

**Maximum kinetic energy depends only on**:
- Frequency (or wavelength) of incident photons
- Work function of the metal

If frequency increases at constant intensity, photoelectric current **decreases** because fewer photons are needed to maintain the same energy transfer rate.

## The Photoelectric Equation

$$hf = \Phi + E_{k(\text{max})}$$

Or equivalently:

$$E_{k(\text{max})} = hf - \Phi = \frac{1}{2}mv_{\text{max}}^2$$

Where:
- $h$ = Planck's constant (J s)
- $f$ = frequency of incident radiation (Hz)
- $\Phi$ = work function of the material (J)
- $E_{k(\text{max})}$ = maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons (J)

**Key points**:
- At threshold frequency $f_0$: $hf_0 = \Phi$ (photoelectron just escapes with zero KE)
- $E_{k(\text{max})}$ depends only on frequency, **not** intensity
- Most photoelectrons have KE less than $E_{k(\text{max})}$

### Graphical Analysis

Plotting $E_{k(\text{max})}$ against $f$ gives a straight line:

$$E_{k(\text{max})} = hf - \Phi$$

Comparing to $y = mx + c$:
- **Gradient** = Planck's constant $h$
- **y-intercept** = $-\Phi$ (work function)
- **x-intercept** = $f_0$ (threshold frequency)
- No electrons emitted below $f_0$

## Maximum Kinetic Energy

### Why Kinetic Energy is Independent of Intensity

- Each electron absorbs **one photon only**
- KE depends only on **frequency** of incident radiation
- Intensity relates to **number of photons** striking the metal
- Increasing intensity increases number of photoelectrons, **not** their KE

### Why Kinetic Energy is a Maximum

- All electrons absorb the same photon energy
- Energy required to remove electrons varies with depth in metal
- **Surface electrons** require least energy → have maximum KE
- **Deeper electrons** lose energy reaching the surface → have lower KE

---

## Photoelectric Current

**Photoelectric current**: A measure of the number of photoelectrons emitted per second.

$$\text{Photoelectric current} = n \times e$$

Where $n$ = number of electrons emitted per second.

- Photoelectric current is **proportional to intensity** (for $f > f_0$)
- Intensity ∝ number of photons per second
- Each photon releases one electron

### Effect of Changing Frequency at Constant Intensity

Intensity: $I = \frac{nhf}{tA}$

At constant intensity, if frequency $f$ increases, number of photons $n$ must **decrease** (higher energy photons needed). This causes photoelectric current to **decrease**.

## Exam Tips

- Converting between eV and J is frequently tested — practise this skill
- The stopping voltage is technically negative, but use magnitude in calculations
- Ensure $hf$, $\Phi$, and $E_{k(\text{max})}$ are in **same units** (usually convert eV to J)
- Remember: intensity affects **number** of photoelectrons, frequency affects **energy**
- The coconut shy analogy: low-frequency photons are like table tennis balls (no emission); high-frequency photons are like bullets (instant emission)
