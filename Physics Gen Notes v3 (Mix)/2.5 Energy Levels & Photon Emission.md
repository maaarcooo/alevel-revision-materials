# 2.5 Energy Levels & Photon Emission

## Electron Energy Levels

Electrons in atoms occupy discrete **energy levels** (quantum states). Electrons occupy the lowest available energy level as this is the most stable configuration.

- **Ground state** (n = 1): The lowest energy level; most negative energy value
- **Excited state** (n = 2, 3, 4...): Higher energy levels with less negative energy values
- **Excitation**: Electron absorbs energy and moves to a higher energy level
- **De-excitation**: Electron releases energy and moves to a lower energy level

**Ionisation** occurs when an electron gains sufficient energy to be completely removed from the atom. The **ionisation energy** is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the ground state.

## Fluorescence

**Fluorescence** occurs when electrons absorb energy (from photons or electron collisions), excite, then de-excite by emitting photons.

**Fluorescent tube operation:**
1. High voltage causes electrons to flow from cathode to anode
2. Beam electrons collide with mercury atoms, transferring energy
3. Mercury electrons ionise and subsequently de-excite, emitting UV photons
4. UV photons excite electrons in the phosphor coating
5. Phosphor electrons de-excite, emitting visible light

## Line Spectra

**Line spectra** (or **atomic spectra**) are produced when excited atoms emit light at specific wavelengths corresponding to electron transitions. Each element has a unique set of spectral lines.

### Emission Spectra
Produced when electrons de-excite and emit photons. Appears as coloured lines on a dark background.

### Absorption Spectra
Produced when atoms absorb photons of specific wavelengths. Appears as dark lines on a continuous spectrum.

- When white light passes through a gas, specific wavelengths are absorbed and re-emitted in random directions
- The dark lines in an absorption spectrum correspond exactly to the bright lines in the emission spectrum of the same element

**Key evidence:** Line spectra demonstrate that electrons can only transition between discrete energy levels.

## Photon Energy Equation

The energy of an emitted/absorbed photon equals the difference between two energy levels:

$$\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$

Where:
- $\Delta E$ = energy difference (J)
- $h$ = Planck's constant = $6.63 \times 10^{-34}$ J s
- $f$ = frequency (Hz)
- $c$ = speed of light = $3 \times 10^{8}$ m s⁻¹
- $\lambda$ = wavelength (m)

**Important relationship:** Photon energy and wavelength are inversely proportional — the largest energy transition produces the shortest wavelength.

## Wave-Particle Duality

Light and matter exhibit both wave and particle properties — this is **wave-particle duality**.

### Evidence for Particle Nature of Light
The **photoelectric effect** demonstrates that:
- Light energy is carried in discrete packets called **photons**
- Photon energy is quantised: $E = hf$
- Only frequencies above the **threshold frequency** cause photoelectron emission
- Photoelectrons are emitted instantaneously (not gradually)
- Increasing intensity increases the number of photoelectrons, not their maximum kinetic energy

### Evidence for Wave Nature of Light
**Diffraction and interference** (e.g., Young's Double-Slit Experiment) demonstrate wave behaviour.

### Why Wave Theory Fails for Photoelectric Effect
- Wave theory predicts any frequency could cause emission given sufficient time
- Wave theory predicts energy absorption would be gradual
- Wave theory predicts kinetic energy should increase with intensity

None of these predictions match experimental observations.

## Electron Diffraction

Louis de Broglie proposed that matter also exhibits wave behaviour.

**Experimental evidence:** When electrons pass through a thin graphite film (crystalline structure), a **diffraction pattern** of **concentric rings** forms on the screen.

- The gaps between atomic planes in the crystal act as slits
- If electrons were purely particles, they would produce uniform distribution, not rings
- This confirms wave-particle duality for matter

### Effect of Accelerating Voltage
| Accelerating Voltage | Speed | Momentum | Wavelength | Ring Diameter |
|---------------------|-------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Higher | Higher | Higher | Shorter | Smaller |
| Lower | Lower | Lower | Longer | Larger |

**Kinetic energy of accelerated electrons:**

$$E_k = eV$$

Where $e$ = electron charge and $V$ = accelerating voltage.

## The de Broglie Equation

The **de Broglie equation** relates wavelength to momentum:

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{mv}$$

Where:
- $\lambda$ = de Broglie wavelength (m)
- $h$ = Planck's constant = $6.63 \times 10^{-34}$ J s
- $p$ = momentum (kg m s⁻¹)
- $m$ = mass (kg)
- $v$ = velocity (m s⁻¹)

### Wavelength in Terms of Kinetic Energy

Since $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ and $p = mv$:

$$E_k = \frac{p^2}{2m} \quad \Rightarrow \quad p = \sqrt{2mE_k}$$

Therefore:

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2mE_k}}$$

### Key Relationships
- **Smaller momentum** → **longer wavelength** → larger diffraction rings
- **Larger momentum** → **shorter wavelength** → smaller diffraction rings

### Applications
- Diffraction patterns reveal crystal structure
- High-energy electrons (short wavelength) can probe nuclear dimensions

## The Scientific Community

### Peer Review
**Peer review** is the process where scientific research is evaluated by experts in the field before publication.

**Criteria assessed:**
- **Validity**: Is the method appropriate? Are errors addressed?
- **Originality**: Are the results new?
- **Significance**: Are the findings important?

Research must also be:
- **Repeatable**: Same scientists can reproduce results
- **Reproducible**: Other scientists can reproduce results

Non-peer-reviewed claims should be questioned due to potential issues with methodology, interpretation, or conclusions.
