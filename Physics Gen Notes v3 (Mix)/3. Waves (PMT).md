# 3. Waves

## 3.1 Progressive Waves

A **progressive wave** transfers energy without transferring material. It consists of particles of a medium (or field) oscillating.

### Wave Properties

| Property | Definition | Units |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Amplitude** | Maximum displacement from the equilibrium position | m |
| **Frequency** ($f$) | Number of complete oscillations passing through a point per second | Hz |
| **Wavelength** ($\lambda$) | Length of one whole oscillation (distance between successive peaks/troughs) | m |
| **Speed** ($c$) | Distance travelled by the wave per unit time | m/s |
| **Phase** | Position of a point on a wave cycle | radians, degrees, or fractions of a cycle |
| **Phase difference** | How much a particle/wave lags behind another | radians, degrees, or fractions of a cycle |
| **Period** ($T$) | Time taken for one full oscillation | s |

### Phase Relationships

Two points are **in phase** when:
- They are at the same point of the wave cycle
- They have the **same displacement and velocity**
- Phase difference is a **multiple of 360°** ($2\pi$ radians)
- They need only the same frequency and wavelength, not the same amplitude

Two points are **completely out of phase** when they are an **odd integer of half cycles apart** (e.g., 180°, 540°). One half cycle equals 180° ($\pi$ radians).

### Key Equations

$$c = f\lambda$$

$$f = \frac{1}{T}$$

## 3.2 Longitudinal and Transverse Waves

### Transverse Waves

**Transverse waves** have oscillations at **right angles to the direction of energy transfer**.

- All **electromagnetic (EM) waves** are **transverse** and travel at $3 \times 10^8$ m/s in a vacuum
- Demonstrated by shaking a slinky **vertically** or using waves on a string attached to a signal generator

### Longitudinal Waves

**Longitudinal waves** have oscillations **parallel to the direction of energy transfer**.

- Made up of **compressions and rarefactions**
- Cannot travel in a vacuum
- **Sound** is an example
- Demonstrated by pushing a slinky **horizontally**

### Polarisation

A **polarised wave** oscillates in **only one plane**. **Only transverse waves can be polarised**.

Polarisation provides **evidence for the nature of transverse waves** because it can only occur if oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of travel.

**Applications of polarisation:**
- **Polaroid sunglasses**: Reduce glare by **blocking partially polarised light** reflected from water and tarmac, allowing only oscillations in the plane of the filter
- **TV and radio signals**: Plane-polarised by the orientation of transmitting aerial rods; receiving aerial must be aligned in the same plane to receive the signal at **full strength**

## 3.3 Superposition and Stationary Waves

### Principle of Superposition

**Superposition** occurs when the **displacements** of two waves are combined as they pass each other. The resultant displacement is the **vector sum** of each wave's displacement.

**Constructive interference**: Occurs when two waves have displacement in the **same direction**

**Destructive interference**: Occurs when one wave has positive displacement and the other has negative displacement. **Total destructive interference** occurs when waves have **equal but opposite** displacements.

### Stationary Waves

A **stationary wave** is formed from the **superposition of 2 progressive waves** travelling in **opposite directions** in the same plane, with the **same frequency, wavelength and amplitude**.

**No energy is transferred** by a stationary wave.

- **Antinodes**: Regions of **maximum amplitude**, formed where waves meet **in phase** (constructive interference)
- **Nodes**: Regions of **no displacement**, formed where waves meet **completely out of phase** (destructive interference)

The **distance between adjacent nodes (or antinodes) is half a wavelength** for any harmonic.

### Formation Example

A string fixed at one end and attached to a driving oscillator at the other:
- A wave travelling down the string is **reflected** at the fixed end
- The reflected wave travels back causing superposition
- Since waves have the same wavelength, frequency and amplitude, a stationary wave forms

### Harmonics

The **first harmonic** is the lowest frequency at which a stationary wave forms, producing two nodes and one antinode.

$$f = \frac{1}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$

Where:
- $L$ = length of vibrating string
- $T$ = tension
- $\mu$ = mass per unit length

For the **nth harmonic**: frequency = $n \times$ first harmonic frequency, with $n$ antinodes.

### Examples of Stationary Waves

- **Stationary microwaves**: Formed by reflecting a microwave beam at a metal plate; use a **microwave probe** to find nodes and antinodes
- **Stationary sound waves**: Speaker at one end of closed glass tube with powder across the bottom; powder shakes at antinodes and settles at nodes. Using $c = f\lambda$, the speed of sound can be found

## 3.4 Interference

### Path Difference and Coherence

**Path difference**: The difference in distance travelled by two waves, usually expressed in terms of wavelength.

A **coherent** light source has the **same frequency and wavelength** and a **fixed phase difference**.

**Lasers** are coherent and **monochromatic** (emit a single or small range of wavelengths), making them ideal for diffraction experiments as they form clear interference patterns.

### Young's Double-Slit Experiment

Demonstrates **interference of light from two sources**.

**Procedure:**
1. Shine coherent light through 2 slits about the **same size as the wavelength**
2. Light diffracts through each slit
3. Each slit acts as a **coherent point source**
4. A pattern of light and dark **fringes** forms

**Light fringes** (constructive interference): Path difference = **whole number of wavelengths** ($n\lambda$)

**Dark fringes** (destructive interference): Path difference = **whole number and a half wavelengths** ($(n + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$)

### Double-Slit Equation

$$w = \frac{\lambda D}{s}$$

Where:
- $w$ = fringe spacing
- $\lambda$ = wavelength of light
- $D$ = distance between screen and slits
- $s$ = slit separation

### White Light Interference

Using **white light** instead of monochromatic laser light produces:
- **Wider maxima**
- **Less intense** diffraction pattern
- **Central white fringe**
- Alternating bright fringes which are **spectra** (violet closest to central maximum, red furthest)

### Laser Safety Precautions

- Wear **laser safety goggles**
- **Don't** shine at **reflective surfaces**
- Display a **warning sign**
- Never shine at a person

### Sound Wave Interference

Interference can be demonstrated using two speakers connected to the same signal generator. Intensity is measured with a microphone to find **maxima** (equivalent to light fringes) and **minima** (equivalent to dark fringes).

### Evidence for Wave Nature of Light

Young's double-slit experiment provided evidence for the **wave nature of light** because **diffraction and interference are wave properties**, proving EM radiation acts as a wave. This disproved earlier particle theories. **Knowledge and understanding of any scientific concept changes over time in accordance to the experimental evidence gathered** by the scientific community.

## 3.5 Diffraction

**Diffraction** is the **spreading out** of waves when they pass through or around a gap.

- **Greatest diffraction** occurs when the gap is the **same size** as the wavelength
- Gap smaller than wavelength: most waves are **reflected**
- Gap larger than wavelength: **less noticeable** diffraction
- Wave meeting an **obstacle**: diffraction occurs around edges; **wider** obstacle = **less diffraction**

### Single-Slit Diffraction

**Monochromatic** light diffracted through a single slit produces:
- **Bright central fringe** (double the width of other fringes)
- Alternating dark and bright fringes with **decreasing intensity** from centre
- Bright fringes: **constructive interference** (waves meet **in phase**)
- Dark fringes: **destructive interference** (waves **completely out of phase**)

### Effect of Variables on Central Maximum

| Change | Effect on Central Maximum |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Increasing slit width** | **Narrower**, intensity **increases** |
| **Increasing wavelength** | **Wider**, intensity **decreases** |

### White Light Single-Slit Diffraction

- **Central white maximum**
- Alternating bright fringes which are **spectra**
- **Violet closest** to central maximum, **red furthest away**

## 3.6 Diffraction Gratings

A **diffraction grating** contains many **equally spaced slits very close together**. When **monochromatic light** passes through, the interference pattern is **sharper and brighter** than with a double slit because more rays reinforce the pattern, making measurements more accurate.

### Orders of Diffraction

- **Zero order line**: Central ray passing through the grating
- **First order lines**: Either side of zero order
- **Second order lines**: Outside first order lines, etc.

### Diffraction Grating Equation

$$d \sin\theta = n\lambda$$

Where:
- $d$ = distance between slits (slit spacing)
- $\theta$ = angle to normal made by the maximum
- $n$ = order number
- $\lambda$ = wavelength

As $\lambda$ increases, $\theta$ increases (more diffraction), so the pattern **spreads out**.

**Maximum value of $\sin\theta$ is 1**, so values of $n$ giving $\sin\theta > 1$ are impossible.

### Derivation of the Equation

1. For **first order maximum**, path difference between adjacent rays = one wavelength
2. A right-angled triangle forms with sides $d$ and $\lambda$
3. Using trigonometry: $\sin\theta = \frac{\lambda}{d}$, rearranging gives $d\sin\theta = \lambda$
4. For other maxima where path difference = $n\lambda$: $d\sin\theta = n\lambda$

### Applications of Diffraction Gratings

- **Line absorption spectra** from stars: Used to identify elements present
- **X-ray crystallography**: X-rays directed at thin crystal sheets (which act as diffraction gratings) produce diffraction patterns used to measure **atomic spacing**, since X-ray wavelengths are similar to gaps between atoms

## 3.7 Refraction

### Refractive Index

**Refractive index** ($n$) measures how much a material slows down light passing through it.

$$n = \frac{c}{c_s}$$

Where:
- $c$ = speed of light in a vacuum
- $c_s$ = speed of light in the substance

A **higher refractive index** means **more optically dense**.

The refractive index of **air is approximately 1** (light doesn't slow down significantly compared to vacuum).

### Snell's Law

**Refraction** occurs when a wave enters a different medium, causing it to change direction.

$$n_1 \sin\theta_1 = n_2 \sin\theta_2$$

Where:
- $n_1$, $n_2$ = refractive indices of materials 1 and 2
- $\theta_1$ = angle of incidence
- $\theta_2$ = angle of refraction

**Speed changes** at the boundary cause **direction to change**:
- Into more optically dense medium ($n_2 > n_1$): bends **towards normal**
- Into less optically dense medium ($n_2 < n_1$): bends **away from normal**

### Critical Angle and Total Internal Reflection

As angle of incidence increases, angle of refraction increases towards 90°.

**Critical angle** ($\theta_c$): When angle of refraction = **exactly 90°** (light refracted along boundary).

$$\sin\theta_c = \frac{n_2}{n_1} \quad \text{where } n_1 > n_2$$

**Total internal reflection (TIR)** occurs when:
- Angle of incidence > critical angle
- $n_1 > n_2$ (travelling from more to less optically dense medium)

---

## 3.8 Optical Fibres

**Optical fibres** are flexible, thin tubes of plastic or glass that carry information as light signals via total internal reflection.

### Structure

- **Optically dense core**: Carries the light signal
- **Cladding** (lower optical density): 
  - Enables TIR to occur
  - **Protects core from damage**
  - Prevents **signal degradation** through **light escaping the core**
  - Improves tensile strength
  - Prevents scratching
  - Prevents signal transfer between adjacent fibres

### Signal Degradation

**Absorption**: Part of signal energy is absorbed by the fibre, **reducing amplitude**, potentially causing information loss.

**Dispersion**: Causes **pulse broadening** (received signal broader than transmitted), leading to overlapping signals and information loss.

**Types of dispersion:**

| Type | Cause | Solution |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Modal** | Light rays enter at different angles, taking different paths and times | **Narrow core** (reduces path length differences) |
| **Material** | Different wavelengths travel at different speeds | **Monochromatic light** |

**Optical fibre repeaters** reduce both absorption and dispersion by **regenerating the signal** during transmission.
