# 3.1 Longitudinal & Transverse Waves

## Progressive Waves

A **progressive wave** is a wave that transfers energy from one point to another without transferring the medium itself.

### Properties of a Progressive Wave

| Property | Symbol | Definition | Unit |
|----------|--------|------------|------|
| **Displacement** | $x$ | Distance of a point on the wave from its equilibrium position (vector quantity — can be positive or negative) | m |
| **Amplitude** | $A$ | Maximum displacement of a particle from its equilibrium position | m |
| **Wavelength** | $\lambda$ | Distance between points on successive oscillations that are in phase | m |
| **Period** | $T$ | Time taken for one complete oscillation or cycle | s |
| **Frequency** | $f$ | Number of complete oscillations per unit time | Hz (s⁻¹) |
| **Speed** | $v$ | Distance travelled by the wave per unit time | m s⁻¹ |

### Key Equations

**Frequency-period relationship:**
$$f = \frac{1}{T}$$

**Wave equation:**
$$v = f\lambda$$

For a wave of constant speed:
- As wavelength increases, frequency decreases
- As wavelength decreases, frequency increases

### Phase Difference

**Phase difference** is a measure of how much a point or wave is in front of or behind another.

- Determined from relative positions of crests or troughs of two waves with the same frequency
- **In phase**: crests or troughs are aligned — phase difference of **360°** or **2π radians**
- **In antiphase**: crest of one wave aligns with trough of another — phase difference of **180°** or **π radians**

**Converting phase difference:**

| Fraction of λ | Degrees | Radians |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| $\frac{1}{4}\lambda$ | 90° | $\frac{\pi}{2}$ |
| $\frac{1}{2}\lambda$ | 180° | $\pi$ |
| $\frac{3}{4}\lambda$ | 270° | $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ |
| $1\lambda$ | 360° | $2\pi$ |

- If wave A reaches a point earlier than wave B, wave A **leads** wave B
- Conversely, wave B **lags** behind wave A

## Longitudinal & Transverse Waves

In mechanical waves, particles **oscillate** about fixed points. Waves are classified by the direction of vibration relative to the direction of travel.

### Transverse Waves

**Definition:** A wave in which the particles oscillate **perpendicular** to the direction of wave travel (and energy transfer).

**Features:**
- Show areas of **crests** (peaks) and **troughs**
- Can be demonstrated using a **rope**
- **Can be polarised**

**Examples:**
- Electromagnetic waves (radio, visible light, UV)
- Vibrations on a guitar string
- Waves on a string
- Seismic S-waves

### Longitudinal Waves

**Definition:** A wave in which the particles oscillate **parallel** to the direction of wave travel (and energy transfer).

**Features:**
- Show areas of **compressions** (regions of increased pressure) and **rarefactions** (regions of decreased pressure)
- One wavelength = distance between two compressions or two rarefactions
- Can be demonstrated using a **slinky spring**
- **Cannot be polarised**

**Energy transfer mechanism:**
1. Particles in the medium vibrate as they receive energy
2. Compressions cause nearby particles to vibrate with more energy
3. This produces a compression further along in the medium

**Examples:**
- Sound waves
- Ultrasound waves
- Seismic P-waves

## Polarisation

**Polarisation** is when particle oscillations occur in a **single plane perpendicular** to the direction of wave propagation.

### Key Points

- **Only transverse waves can be polarised** — because they oscillate in any plane perpendicular to the propagation direction
- Longitudinal waves cannot be polarised — they oscillate parallel to the direction of travel
- When polarised, vibrations are restricted to **one direction** (still perpendicular to propagation)

### Polarisers

A **polariser** (or polarising filter) only allows oscillations in a certain plane to be transmitted.

- An unpolarised wave passing through a polariser becomes polarised
- A polarised wave passing through a filter with transmission axis **perpendicular** to the wave's polarisation plane is completely blocked
- Light can also be polarised through **reflection**, **refraction**, and **scattering**

### Two Polarisers Experiment

**Parallel transmission axes:**
- Filter A polarises light in a certain axis
- All polarised light passes through filter B
- **Maximum intensity** transmitted

**Perpendicular transmission axes (90° rotation):**
- Filter A polarises light in a certain axis
- No polarised light passes through filter B
- **Minimum intensity** (zero) transmitted

**Intensity variation:** As the second polariser rotates through 360°, intensity varies periodically between maximum (at 0°, 180°, 360°) and zero (at 90°, 270°).

## Applications of Polarisers

### Polaroid Sunglasses

- Contain polarising filters with **vertically oriented** transmission axes
- Block **horizontally polarised light**
- Light reflected from horizontal surfaces (water, wet roads) undergoes **partial plane polarisation** — more oscillation in the horizontal plane
- Sunglasses eliminate this glare, allowing clearer vision of objects underwater

### Polaroid Photography

- Reduces glare and intensifies colour on bright days
- Enables underwater photography:
  - Surface glare (reflected, horizontally polarised) is eliminated by the filter
  - Light from underwater objects is **refracted** (not reflected), so not plane-polarised
  - Underwater objects appear brighter than the eliminated glare

### Radio & Microwave Signals

- Broadcasting towers transmit **horizontally-polarised** or **vertically-polarised** signals
- Reception aerials must be mounted to match the polarisation:
  - Horizontal aerial for horizontally polarised signals
  - Vertical aerial for vertically polarised signals
- Orientation depends on the transmitter and polarity of services being broadcast

## Key Equations Summary

| Equation | Variables |
|----------|-----------|
| $f = \frac{1}{T}$ | $f$ = frequency (Hz), $T$ = period (s) |
| $v = f\lambda$ | $v$ = wave speed (m s⁻¹), $f$ = frequency (Hz), $\lambda$ = wavelength (m) |

## Exam Tips

- Wave equation may be written as $c = f\lambda$ where $c$ is wave speed — however, $c$ often represents the speed of light ($3 \times 10^8$ m s⁻¹), so use $v$ for speeds other than light
- When labelling wavelength/period on diagrams: arrows must go from the very top of one wave to the very top of the next — arrows that are too short lose marks
- For amplitude: do not draw an arrow from bottom to top of the wave — this shows peak-to-peak distance, not amplitude
- Definitions of transverse and longitudinal waves are frequently examined — memorise them precisely
- Polarisation only occurs for transverse waves — this is a common multiple-choice discriminator
