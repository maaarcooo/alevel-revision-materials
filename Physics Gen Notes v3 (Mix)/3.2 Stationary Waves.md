# 3.2 Stationary Waves

## Formation of Stationary Waves

**Stationary waves** (standing waves) are produced by the **superposition** of two waves of the same frequency and amplitude travelling in **opposite directions**. This is typically achieved by a travelling wave and its reflection.

The superposition produces a wave pattern where peaks and troughs **do not move**.

## Progressive vs Stationary Waves

| Feature | Progressive Waves | Stationary Waves |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Amplitude** | All points have the same amplitude | Each point has different amplitude depending on position |
| **Phase** | Points one wavelength apart are in phase; phase varies 0–360° within one wavelength | Points between nodes are in phase; points either side of a node are in antiphase |
| **Energy** | Transferred along the wave | Stored, not transferred |
| **Nodes/Antinodes** | None | Present |
| **Wave speed** | Speed at which wave moves through medium | Overall wave does not move; individual points oscillate at different speeds |

---

## Nodes and Antinodes

- **Nodes**: Regions of **zero vibration** (no displacement)
- **Antinodes**: Regions of **maximum amplitude** vibration

Nodes are **fixed** in position. Antinodes oscillate vertically but do not move horizontally along the wave.

### Phase Relationships

- Points **between nodes** are **in phase** with each other
- Points separated by an **odd** number of nodes are **out of phase** (antiphase)
- Points separated by an **even** number of nodes are **in phase**

## Superposition and Interference

The **principle of superposition** states that the resultant displacement at any point equals the **sum of the individual wave displacements**.

### At Nodes
- Waves are in **antiphase**
- **Destructive interference** occurs → waves cancel out
- Resultant amplitude = 0

### At Antinodes
- Waves are **in phase**
- **Constructive interference** occurs
- Resultant amplitude = **double** the original amplitude

## Demonstrations of Stationary Waves

### Stretched String
A string under tension, fixed at one end and attached to a vibration generator at the other. At specific frequencies, characteristic patterns of nodes and antinodes form.

### Microwaves
A microwave source aligned with a reflecting plate; a detector between them identifies nodes and antinodes as the reflector position is varied.

### Sound Waves in Air Columns
Fine powder in a tube settles at **nodes** (zero disturbance). A loudspeaker at the open end creates an **antinode** there; the closed end has a **node**.

## Harmonics on Strings

For a string of length $L$ with **both ends fixed** (nodes at each end):

### First Harmonic (Fundamental Frequency)
- **2 nodes**, **1 antinode**
- Wavelength: $\lambda = 2L$
- Frequency: 

$$f_1 = \frac{v}{2L}$$

### Second Harmonic
- **3 nodes**, **2 antinodes**
- Wavelength: $\lambda = L$
- Frequency: $f_2 = 2f_1$

### Third Harmonic
- **4 nodes**, **3 antinodes**
- Wavelength: $\lambda = \frac{2L}{3}$
- Frequency: $f_3 = 3f_1$

### General Pattern (nth Harmonic)

| Harmonic | Nodes | Antinodes | Wavelength | Frequency |
|----------|-------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| 1st | 2 | 1 | $2L$ | $f_1 = \frac{v}{2L}$ |
| 2nd | 3 | 2 | $L$ | $2f_1$ |
| 3rd | 4 | 3 | $\frac{2L}{3}$ | $3f_1$ |
| nth | $n+1$ | $n$ | $\frac{2L}{n}$ | $nf_1$ |

**Key relationship**: $f_n = n \times f_1$

## Wave Speed on a String

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$

Where:
- $v$ = wave speed (m s⁻¹)
- $T$ = tension (N)
- $\mu$ = mass per unit length (kg m⁻¹)

### First Harmonic Frequency Equation

Combining wave speed with $\lambda = 2L$:

$$f = \frac{1}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$

## Required Practical: Investigating Stationary Waves

### Aim
Measure how the frequency of the first harmonic varies with:
- Length of string ($L$)
- Tension ($T$)
- Mass per unit length ($\mu$)

**Dependent variable**: Frequency of first harmonic

### Apparatus
- Signal generator and vibration generator
- Retort stand with G clamp/2 kg mass for stability
- 2.0 m string
- Pulley and wooden bridge
- Mass hanger + 100 g masses
- Metre ruler
- Top-pan balance (to find $\mu$)

### Method (Varying Length)
1. Attach string to vibration generator; pass over pulley with masses hanging
2. Set length $L$ using wooden bridge; measure with metre ruler
3. Increase signal generator frequency until first harmonic observed
4. Record frequency; repeat for different lengths
5. Take at least 3 readings per length and average
6. Calculate tension: $T = mg$

### Analysis
Rearranging the first harmonic equation:

$$f = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} \times \frac{1}{L}$$

- Plot $f$ against $\frac{1}{L}$
- Gradient = $\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$
- Verify wave speed: $v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$

### Improving Accuracy
- Use oscilloscope to verify signal generator readings
- Allow signal generator ~20 minutes to stabilise
- Use maximum practical string length for better resolution
- **Finding resonance**: Reduce frequency, increase slowly until first harmonic appears; note frequency. Then increase past resonance and reduce back down; note frequency again. Average the readings.

### Safety
Stand clear of hanging masses in case they fall.
