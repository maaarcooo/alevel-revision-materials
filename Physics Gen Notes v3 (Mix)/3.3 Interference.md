# 3.3 Interference

## Principle of Superposition

The **principle of superposition** states that when two or more waves overlap at a point, the **displacement at that point equals the sum of the displacements** of the individual waves.

## Interference

**Interference** is the effect of superposition when waves overlap.

| Type | Condition | Result |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Constructive interference** | Waves meet **in phase** | Displacements add; **larger amplitude** |
| **Destructive interference** | Waves meet **in antiphase** (180° out of phase) | Displacements cancel; **zero or reduced amplitude** |

When waves are neither completely in phase nor antiphase, partial interference occurs — displacements combine algebraically.

## Coherence

**Coherent** sources emit waves with:
- **Same frequency**
- **Constant phase difference**

Examples: laser light, two speakers driven by the same signal, light passing through Young's double slit.

## Path Difference and Phase Difference

**Path difference** — the difference in distance travelled by two waves from their sources to a common point.

**Phase difference** — the difference in position within the wave cycle between two coherent waves at a point.

### Conditions for Interference

| Interference Type | Path Difference Condition |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Constructive** | $\text{Path difference} = n\lambda$ (whole number of wavelengths) |
| **Destructive** | $\text{Path difference} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\lambda$ (odd number of half wavelengths) |

where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$

## Wavefront Diagrams

A **wavefront diagram** represents each wavefront (peak or trough) as a curved line.

- **Peak meets peak** or **trough meets trough** → constructive interference (maximum displacement)
- **Peak meets trough** → destructive interference (zero displacement)

## Lasers

Laser light is ideal for diffraction experiments because it is:
- **Coherent** — constant phase difference and frequency
- **Monochromatic** — single wavelength

### Laser Safety

- Never look directly at a laser beam or its reflection
- Display warning signs when lasers are in use
- Remove reflective surfaces from the room
- Wear appropriate laser safety goggles
- Turn off when not in use

## Two-Source Interference

### Sound Waves

Two speakers emitting coherent sound produce interference:
- **Constructive**: compressions align with compressions, rarefactions with rarefactions → louder sound
- **Destructive**: compression aligns with rarefaction → silence (noise-cancelling technology)

### Microwaves

Detected using a moveable detector — maximum signal at constructive interference regions.

### Intensity and Amplitude

$$I \propto A^2$$

**Intensity is proportional to the square of amplitude.**

## Young's Double Slit Experiment

A single wave source passes through a double slit, creating two coherent sources.

### Setup
1. Laser → single slit (diffracts light) → double slit → screen
2. Single slit ensures both double slits act as coherent sources

### Pattern Characteristics

- **Bright fringes**: equal width and intensity; formed by constructive interference
- **Dark fringes**: narrow bands of zero intensity; formed by destructive interference
- Fringes are evenly spaced

### Path Difference in Double Slit

| Fringe Type | Path Difference |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Maxima (bright) | $n\lambda$ |
| Minima (dark) | $\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\lambda$ |

where $n$ is the order number (position from central maximum).

## Double Slit Equation

$$w = \frac{\lambda D}{s}$$

| Symbol | Quantity | Unit |
|--------|----------|------|
| $w$ | Fringe spacing (between adjacent bright/dark fringes) | m |
| $\lambda$ | Wavelength | m |
| $D$ | Slit-to-screen distance | m |
| $s$ | Slit separation | m |

**Fringe spacing increases if:**
- Wavelength $\lambda$ increases
- Distance $D$ increases
- Slit separation $s$ decreases

## White Light Interference

When white light passes through a double slit:

- **Central maximum is white** — all wavelengths interfere constructively
- Dark fringes either side of centre
- **Other maxima show spectra** — violet/blue nearest centre (diffracted least), red furthest (diffracted most)
- Fringes get closer together away from centre; spectra eventually merge

## Historical Development of Wave Theory

| Scientist | Contribution |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Newton** | Light as stream of particles (corpuscles) |
| **Huygens** | Wave theory — wavefronts as sources of secondary waves |
| **Young** | Double slit experiment — proved light undergoes interference |
| **Maxwell** | Light as electromagnetic waves |
| **Einstein** | Light as photons — wave-particle duality |

## Required Practical: Measuring Wavelength

### Method 1: Young's Double Slit

**Aim:** Investigate relationship between slit-screen distance $D$ and fringe width $w$.

**Procedure:**
1. Fix laser and double slit; place screen at distance $D$
2. Measure across multiple fringes; divide by number of fringes to find mean $w$
3. Repeat for different values of $D$

**Analysis:**

Rearranging: $w = \frac{\lambda}{s} \times D$

- Plot $w$ against $D$
- Gradient $= \frac{\lambda}{s}$
- $\lambda = \text{gradient} \times s$

### Method 2: Diffraction Grating

**Equation:**

$$d \sin\theta = n\lambda$$

| Symbol | Quantity |
|--------|----------|
| $d$ | Slit spacing $\left(d = \frac{1}{N}\right)$ where $N$ = lines per metre |
| $\theta$ | Angle to $n$th order maximum |
| $n$ | Order number |

**Finding angle:**

$$\tan\theta = \frac{h}{D}$$

where $h$ = distance from central to $n$th maximum, $D$ = grating-to-screen distance.

### Improving Accuracy

- Use set square to ensure normal incidence and avoid parallax
- Measure from centre of bright spots
- Take multiple measurements (3–8) and average
- Use Vernier callipers to reduce percentage uncertainty
- Measure across all visible fringes, divide by number of fringes
- Increase $D$ to increase fringe separation (reduces intensity)
