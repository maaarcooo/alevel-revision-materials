# 3.4 Diffraction

## What is Diffraction?

**Diffraction** is the spreading out of waves after they pass through a narrow gap or around an obstruction.

- Diffraction effects are most significant when the **wavelength ≈ gap width**
- Waves spread out in circular arcs from the aperture

## Single Slit Diffraction

### Diffraction Pattern

When monochromatic light passes through a single slit, it produces a pattern of light and dark fringes:

- **Bright fringes**: caused by constructive interference of wavefront parts
- **Dark fringes**: caused by destructive interference of wavefront parts

**Key features** (compared to double slit):

- **Central maximum** is much wider and brighter than all other fringes
- Subsidiary maxima are narrower and less bright than the central maximum
- Subsidiary maxima decrease in intensity with distance from centre
- Dark fringes have zero intensity

### White Light Diffraction

When white light is diffracted through a single slit:

- **Central maximum** is bright white (constructive interference for all wavelengths)
- All other maxima show a **spectrum** of colours
- **Violet/blue** appears nearest to centre (diffracted less — shorter wavelength)
- **Red** appears furthest from centre (diffracted more — longer wavelength)
- Spectra eventually merge at large distances from centre as fringe spacing decreases

**Compared to monochromatic light:**

- Central maxima has equal intensity
- Non-central maxima are wider and less intense
- Fringe spacing decreases with distance from centre

## Comparing Single and Double Slit Patterns

| Feature | Double Slit | Single Slit |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Fringe spacing | Equally spaced | Central maximum much wider |
| Intensity | Approximately equal maxima | Central maximum brightest; others decrease |
| Pattern | Uniform interference fringes | Distinctive central maximum with envelope |

The single slit diffraction pattern acts as an **envelope** modulating the double slit interference pattern.

## Factors Affecting Diffraction

### Effect of Gap Width

- **Narrower slit** → more diffraction → greater angle of diffraction → wider fringes
- **Wider slit** → less diffraction → smaller angle of diffraction → narrower fringes
- Maximum diffraction occurs when wavelength ≈ gap size

### Effect of Wavelength

- **Longer wavelength** (e.g., red) → more diffraction → wider fringes
- **Shorter wavelength** (e.g., blue) → less diffraction → narrower fringes

## Diffraction Gratings

### Structure

A **diffraction grating** consists of many parallel, equally spaced slits cut into a glass plate.

**Advantages over double slit:**

- Produces sharper patterns
- Bright fringes are narrower and brighter
- Dark regions are darker (better resolution)

### The Diffraction Grating Equation

$$d \sin\theta = n\lambda$$

Where:

- $d$ = slit spacing (distance between adjacent slits) in metres
- $\theta$ = angle of diffraction from the normal
- $n$ = order of maximum (n = 0, 1, 2, 3...)
- $\lambda$ = wavelength of light in metres

### Calculating Slit Spacing

If $N$ = number of lines per unit length:

$$d = \frac{1}{N}$$

- If $N$ is in lines/mm → $d$ is in mm
- If $N$ is in lines/m → $d$ is in m

### Angular Separation

Rearranging the grating equation:

$$\sin\theta = \frac{n\lambda}{d}$$

**Key points:**

- Angular separation increases with order number
- Separation between orders: $\theta_2 - \theta_1$
- Maximum observable angle: $\theta = 90°$

### Maximum Order Visible

The highest visible order is found from:

$$n_{max} = \frac{d}{\lambda}$$

- **Round down** to nearest integer (n must be a whole number)
- This gives the highest order where $\sin\theta \leq 1$

### Derivation

For constructive interference, path difference must equal whole number of wavelengths:

- 1st order (n=1): $\sin\theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{d}$
- 2nd order (n=2): $\sin\theta_2 = \frac{2\lambda}{d}$
- nth order: $\sin\theta_n = \frac{n\lambda}{d}$

Rearranging: $d\sin\theta = n\lambda$

## Applications of Diffraction Gratings

### Astronomy and Spectroscopy

- Measure wavelength/frequency of light from stars
- Analyse absorption and emission spectra

### X-ray Crystallography

- Crystal lattice acts as a diffraction grating for X-rays
- X-ray wavelength ≈ atomic spacing in crystals
- Used to determine atomic spacing and crystal structure

### Monochromators

- Select specific wavelengths of light for optical experiments
- Analyse specific wavelengths from tissue samples (medical applications)
- Excite molecules with precise wavelengths

## Key Equations Summary

| Equation | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| $d \sin\theta = n\lambda$ | Diffraction grating equation |
| $d = \frac{1}{N}$ | Slit spacing from lines per unit length |
| $n_{max} = \frac{d}{\lambda}$ | Maximum order visible (round down) |

## Exam Tips

- Always check units: convert lines/mm to lines/m if needed ($\times 10^3$)
- For maximum order, remember to round **down** to nearest integer
- Central maximum (n = 0) is always at $\theta = 0°$
- Wider slit = narrower fringes (inverse relationship)
- Longer wavelength = wider fringes (direct relationship)
