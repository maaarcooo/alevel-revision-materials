# 3.5 Refraction

## Refraction at a Plane Surface

### What is Refraction?

**Refraction** is the change in direction of a wave when it passes through a boundary between mediums of different density. This occurs due to a **change in the speed** of different parts of the wavefront as they hit the boundary.

In optics, **medium** refers to a transparent material.

### Conditions for Refraction

- **More optically dense medium** → waves travel **slower** → **smaller** angle of refraction → light bends **towards** the normal
- **Less optically dense medium** → waves travel **faster** → **larger** angle of refraction → light bends **away** from the normal

### Angles of Incidence and Refraction

- **Angle of incidence** ($\theta_1$): angle between the incident ray and the **normal** line
- **Angle of refraction** ($\theta_2$): angle between the refracted ray and the normal
- The **normal line** is drawn at 90° to the boundary

### Effects on Wave Properties

When light passes between media:

| Transition | Speed | Wavelength | Frequency |
|------------|-------|------------|-----------|
| Less dense → More dense | Decreases | Decreases | Unchanged |
| More dense → Less dense | Increases | Increases | Unchanged |

**Key point**: Frequency remains constant (colour does not change).

When light is incident at **90°** to the boundary, the wave passes **straight through** without changing direction (whole wavefront enters simultaneously).

## Refractive Index

The **refractive index** ($n$) is a property of a material measuring how much light slows down when passing through it.

$$n = \frac{c}{c_s}$$

Where:
- $n$ = refractive index (dimensionless, no units)
- $c$ = speed of light in a vacuum ($3.00 \times 10^8$ m s⁻¹)
- $c_s$ = speed of light in the substance (m s⁻¹)

**Key properties**:
- Refractive index is **always greater than 1** (since $c_s < c$)
- Higher refractive index = **optically dense** material = light travels **slower**
- Refractive index of air ≈ **1** (often written as $n_{air}$ or $n_1$)

## Snell's Law

**Snell's Law** relates the angle of incidence to the angle of refraction at a boundary:

$$n_1 \sin\theta_1 = n_2 \sin\theta_2$$

Or equivalently:

$$\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{\sin\theta_1}{\sin\theta_2}$$

Where:
- $n_1$ = refractive index of material 1 (incident medium)
- $n_2$ = refractive index of material 2 (refracting medium)
- $\theta_1$ = angle of incidence in material 1
- $\theta_2$ = angle of refraction in material 2

**Important**: Angles are always measured from the **normal**, not the boundary.

## Total Internal Reflection

### Critical Angle

The **critical angle** ($\theta_c$) is the angle of incidence at which the angle of refraction equals 90°.

$$\sin\theta_c = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$$

Where $n_1 > n_2$ (light travelling from denser to less dense medium).

**Key relationship**: Larger refractive index → **smaller** critical angle.

### Conditions for Total Internal Reflection

**Total internal reflection (TIR)** occurs when **both** conditions are met:

1. Angle of incidence **greater than** the critical angle ($\theta > \theta_c$)
2. Light travelling from a **denser** to a **less dense** medium ($n_1 > n_2$)

### Three Scenarios at a Boundary

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| $\theta < \theta_c$ | Refraction (ray exits material) |
| $\theta = \theta_c$ | Refraction along boundary (θ₂ = 90°) |
| $\theta > \theta_c$ | Total internal reflection |

**Law of reflection applies**: angle of incidence = angle of reflection.

## Fibre Optics

### Structure of Optical Fibres

**Optical fibres** use total internal reflection to transmit light signals over long distances.

**Three main components**:
1. **Core**: Optically dense tube (plastic or glass) — carries the light signal
2. **Cladding**: Lower optically dense material surrounding the core
3. **Outer sheath**: Protective covering

This is called a **step-index fibre** because refractive index increases from outside to centre.

**Condition for TIR in fibres**: $n_{cladding} < n_{core}$

### Role of Cladding

- **Protects** the thin core from damage and scratching
- **Prevents signal degradation** by stopping light escaping the core
- Keeps **signals secure** and maintains signal quality
- Keeps **core separate** from other fibres, preventing information crossover

### Applications

- **Communications**: telephone and internet transmission
- **Medical imaging**: endoscopes

## Signal Degradation in Optical Fibres

### Absorption

**Absorption** occurs when the fibre absorbs part of the signal's energy.

- **Effect**: Reduces **amplitude** of signal → loss of information

### Pulse Broadening

**Pulse broadening** occurs when pulses emerging from the fibre are **longer** than those entering.

- **Effect**: Merging of pulses → **distorts** information → **decreases amplitude**

---

## Material Dispersion

**Material dispersion** occurs when white light (non-monochromatic) is used instead of monochromatic light.

**Mechanism**:
- Different wavelengths travel at **different speeds** in the medium
- **Violet light** (shortest wavelength) travels **slowest** → smallest angle of incidence/reflection
- Violet undergoes **more reflections** → takes **longer** to travel down fibre
- Beam spreads out as it travels

---

## Modal Dispersion

**Modal dispersion** occurs when monochromatic light pulses spread out due to different path lengths.

**Mechanism**:
- Different parts of the wavefront have **different angles** of incidence
- Each part undergoes TIR a **different number of times**
- Parts reach the end at **slightly different times**

**Key factor**: Effect is more **prominent** when the core is **wider** (more TIR events).

---

## Reducing Signal Degradation

### Reducing Absorption

- Use an **extremely transparent** core material
- Use optical fibre **repeaters** to regenerate the pulse

### Reducing Pulse Broadening

- Use a core as **narrow** as possible (reduces path length differences)
- Use a **monochromatic** source (constant speed, prevents material dispersion)
- Use optical fibre **repeaters** to regenerate pulses
- Use **single-mode fibre** (only single wavelength passes through core)

## Key Equations Summary

| Equation | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| $n = \dfrac{c}{c_s}$ | Refractive index |
| $n_1 \sin\theta_1 = n_2 \sin\theta_2$ | Snell's Law |
| $\sin\theta_c = \dfrac{n_2}{n_1}$ | Critical angle (where $n_1 > n_2$) |

## Exam Tips

- Angles are **always measured from the normal**, not the boundary. If given the angle to the boundary, use $90° - \theta$.
- Refractive index must be **greater than 1** — if your calculation gives less than 1, check your working.
- For **"show that"** questions, give answers to at least one more significant figure than the value stated.
- Ensure calculator is in **degrees mode**, not radians.
- Remember: **frequency never changes** during refraction (colour stays the same).
