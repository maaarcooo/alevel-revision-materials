# 4. Mechanics & Materials

## 4.1 Force, Energy and Momentum

### 4.1.1 Scalars and Vectors

**Scalar**: A quantity with magnitude only. Examples: distance, speed, mass, temperature.

**Vector**: A quantity with both magnitude and direction. Examples: displacement, velocity, force/weight, acceleration.

**Adding Vectors**

- **Calculation method**: Use when vectors are perpendicular. Apply Pythagoras for magnitude and trigonometry for direction.
- **Scale drawing method**: Use when vectors are at angles other than 90°. Draw vectors tip-to-tail using ruler and protractor.

**Resolving Vectors**

Perpendicular components are independent and can be evaluated separately.

For a vector $V$ at angle $\theta$ to the horizontal:

$$x = V \cos\theta \quad \text{(horizontal component)}$$

$$y = V \sin\theta \quad \text{(vertical component)}$$

**Memory aid**: Moving through the angle → use cos; moving away from the angle → use sin.

**Equilibrium**: For an object to be in equilibrium, the sum of all forces acting on it must be zero. The object is either at rest or moving at constant velocity (Newton's first law).

To show equilibrium:
- Sum horizontal and vertical components, showing they equal zero
- For 3 forces: draw a scale diagram — if it forms a **closed triangle**, the object is in equilibrium

### 4.1.2 Moments

**Moment**: The product of a force and the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the force to the pivot.

$$\text{Moment} = F \times d$$

**Couple**: Two equal and opposite parallel forces acting through different lines of action. Causes rotation without translation.

$$\text{Moment of a couple} = F \times \text{perpendicular distance between lines of action}$$

**Principle of Moments**: For an object in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about a pivot equals the sum of anticlockwise moments.

$$\sum \text{clockwise moments} = \sum \text{anticlockwise moments}$$

**Centre of Mass**: The single point through which all the mass of an object can be said to act. For a **uniform** object, the centre of mass is at its geometric centre.

---

### 4.1.3 Motion Along a Straight Line

**Speed**: Scalar quantity describing how quickly an object travels.

**Displacement** ($s$): Vector quantity — overall distance from starting position with direction.

**Velocity** ($v$): Rate of change of displacement.

$$v = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$$

**Acceleration** ($a$): Rate of change of velocity.

$$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$$

**Instantaneous velocity**: Velocity at a specific moment — found from the gradient of a tangent to a displacement-time graph.

**Average velocity**: Total displacement divided by total time.

**Uniform acceleration**: Constant acceleration.

**Graphs**

| Graph Type | Gradient | Area Under Graph |
|------------|----------|------------------|
| Displacement-time | Velocity | — |
| Velocity-time | Acceleration | Displacement |
| Acceleration-time | — | Change in velocity |

**SUVAT Equations** (for uniform acceleration)

$$v = u + at$$

$$s = \frac{(u + v)}{2} t$$

$$s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$

$$v^2 = u^2 + 2as$$

Where: $s$ = displacement, $u$ = initial velocity, $v$ = final velocity, $a$ = acceleration, $t$ = time

### 4.1.4 Projectile Motion

Vertical and horizontal components of motion are **independent** — evaluate them separately using SUVAT equations.

- Horizontal: Constant velocity (no acceleration, ignoring air resistance)
- Vertical: Acceleration = $g$ (9.81 m/s²)

**Free fall**: Object experiences acceleration of $g$ only.

**Friction/Drag/Air resistance**: Force opposing motion. Converts kinetic energy to heat and sound. Magnitude increases with speed.

**Lift**: Upward force on objects in a fluid, caused by redirecting fluid flow. Acts perpendicular to fluid flow direction.

**Terminal Speed/Velocity**: Maximum speed reached when resistive forces equal driving forces. No resultant force, therefore no acceleration.

Skydiver example:
1. Initially accelerates — weight > air resistance
2. Speed increases → air resistance increases
3. When weight = air resistance → terminal velocity reached

**Effect of Air Resistance on Projectiles**:
- Maximum height reached earlier
- Vertical and horizontal distances reduced

---

### 4.1.5 Newton's Laws of Motion

**Newton's First Law**: An object remains at rest or at constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force.

**Newton's Second Law**: The resultant force equals the rate of change of momentum.

$$F = ma$$

**Newton's Third Law**: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Forces act on different objects, are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and of the same type.

**Free-body Diagram**: Shows all forces acting on an object with arrows representing magnitude and direction.

---

### 4.1.6 Momentum

**Momentum**: Product of mass and velocity.

$$p = mv$$

Unit: kg m/s

**Conservation of Momentum**: Total momentum before an event equals total momentum after, provided no external forces act.

$$m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 = m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2$$

**Impulse**: Change in momentum when a force acts on an object.

$$\text{Impulse} = F\Delta t = \Delta(mv)$$

The area under a **force-time graph** equals impulse (change in momentum).

**Safety Applications**: Crumple zones, seat belts, and airbags increase impact time ($\Delta t$), reducing force on passengers for the same change in momentum.

**Types of Collisions**

| Type | Momentum | Kinetic Energy |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Elastic** | Conserved | Conserved |
| **Inelastic** | Conserved | Not conserved (converted to heat, sound, etc.) |

- Objects sticking together → inelastic collision
- Explosions → inelastic (KE increases)

### 4.1.7 Work, Energy and Power

**Work Done**: Force multiplied by distance travelled in the direction of the force.

$$W = Fs\cos\theta$$

Where $\theta$ is the angle between force and direction of motion.

For variable force: Area under **force-displacement graph** = work done.

**Power**: Rate of energy transfer.

$$P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t} = Fv$$

**Efficiency**: Ratio of useful output to total input.

$$\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{useful output power}}{\text{input power}}$$

$$\text{Efficiency (\%)} = \frac{\text{useful output power}}{\text{input power}} \times 100$$

---

### 4.1.8 Conservation of Energy

**Principle of Conservation of Energy**: Energy cannot be created or destroyed — only transferred between forms. Total energy in a closed system remains constant.

$$\text{Total energy in} = \text{Total energy out}$$

**Gravitational Potential Energy**:

$$\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$$

**Kinetic Energy**:

$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

When air resistance is ignored: $\Delta E_p = \Delta E_k$

With air resistance: Some energy is dissipated as heat to the environment.

## 4.2 Materials

### 4.2.1 Bulk Properties of Solids

**Density**: Mass per unit volume.

$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$

**Hooke's Law**: Extension is directly proportional to the force applied, up to the limit of proportionality (environmental conditions constant).

$$F = k\Delta L$$

Where $k$ = **spring constant** (measure of stiffness), $\Delta L$ = extension

**Limit of Proportionality (P)**: Point beyond which Hooke's law no longer applies.

**Elastic Limit (E)**: Point beyond which permanent (plastic) deformation occurs.

**Elastic Behaviour**: Material returns to original shape when deforming force is removed.

**Plastic Behaviour**: Material is permanently deformed when force is removed.

**Tensile Stress**: Force per unit cross-sectional area.

$$\text{Stress} = \frac{F}{A}$$

Unit: Pascal (Pa)

**Tensile Strain**: Extension divided by original length.

$$\text{Strain} = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$$

Strain is dimensionless (no unit).

**Elastic Strain Energy**: Energy stored when a material is stretched.

$$E = \frac{1}{2}F\Delta L$$

Equal to the area under a **force-extension graph**.

**Breaking Stress**: Maximum stress a material can withstand before failure. Depends on conditions (e.g., temperature).

**Material Behaviours**

| Behaviour | Characteristic |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Brittle** | Very little strain before breaking; fractures at low extension |
| **Plastic** | Large extension beyond elastic limit |
| **Ductile** | Large plastic deformation before fracturing |

**Loading and Unloading**

- Beyond elastic limit: graph does not return to origin
- Loading and unloading lines are parallel (constant stiffness)
- Area between curves = work done to permanently deform material

**Energy in Deformation**:
- **Elastic**: All work stored as elastic strain energy
- **Plastic**: Energy dissipated as heat (atoms moved apart permanently)

**Stress-Strain Graphs**: Describe behaviour of a material (not a specific object).

- **Ultimate Tensile Stress (UTS)**: Maximum stress the material can withstand (highest point on graph)
- Gradient of linear region = Young modulus

---

### 4.2.2 Young Modulus

**Young Modulus ($E$)**: Ratio of tensile stress to tensile strain. Describes stiffness of a material.

$$E = \frac{\text{Tensile Stress}}{\text{Tensile Strain}} = \frac{F/A}{\Delta L/L} = \frac{FL}{A\Delta L}$$

Unit: Pascal (Pa)

To find Young modulus from a stress-strain graph: Calculate the **gradient of the straight (linear) region**.
