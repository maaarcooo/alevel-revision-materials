# 4.1 Scalars & Vectors

## Scalars and Vectors

All physical quantities are classified as either **scalars** or **vectors**.

**Scalar**: A quantity with **magnitude** only (no direction).
- Example: **mass** has magnitude but no direction

**Vector**: A quantity with both **magnitude** and **direction**.
- Example: **weight** is a force with both magnitude and direction

### Common Scalars and Vectors

| Scalars | Vectors |
|---------|---------|
| Distance | Displacement |
| Speed | Velocity |
| Mass | Acceleration |
| Time | Force |
| Energy | Momentum |
| Volume | |
| Density | |
| Pressure | |
| Electric charge | |
| Temperature | |

## Distance and Displacement

**Distance**: A measure of how far an object has travelled, **regardless of direction**.
- Total length of the path taken
- Has magnitude but no direction → **scalar**

**Displacement**: A measure of how far it is between two points in space, **including the direction**.
- The length and direction of a **straight line** drawn from the starting point to the finishing point
- Has magnitude and direction → **vector**

---

## Speed and Velocity

**Speed**: A measure of the **distance** travelled by an object per unit time, **regardless of the direction**.
- Describes how fast an object is moving, but not the direction
- Has magnitude but no direction → **scalar**

**Velocity**: A measure of the **displacement** of an object per unit time, **including the direction**.
- Describes how fast an object is moving **and** which direction it is travelling in
- An object can have **constant speed** but **changing velocity** if the object is changing direction
- Has magnitude and direction → **vector**

## Combining Vectors

**Vectors** are represented by arrows:
- **Arrowhead** indicates the **direction**
- **Length** of the arrow represents the **magnitude**

Vectors can be combined by **adding** them to produce the **resultant vector** (also called the 'net' vector).

### Methods for Adding Vectors

| Method | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Calculation** | Vectors are perpendicular (at right angles) |
| **Scale drawing** | Vectors are not perpendicular |

---

## Vector Calculation (Perpendicular Vectors)

For two vectors at **right angles**, the combined vectors form a right-angled triangle.

### Finding Magnitude

Use **Pythagoras' theorem**:

$$R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$

Where $R$ is the resultant vector, and $a$ and $b$ are the component vectors.

**Steps:**
1. Add two vectors $a$ and $b$
2. Link the vectors **head-to-tail**
3. Form the resultant vector from linking the tail of $a$ to the head of $b$
4. Calculate $R$ using Pythagoras' theorem

### Finding Direction

Use **trigonometry** to find the angle from the horizontal or vertical:

$$\tan\theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$$

- Angle from horizontal: $\tan\theta = \frac{b}{a}$
- Angle from vertical: $\tan\theta = \frac{a}{b}$

## Scale Drawing (Non-Perpendicular Vectors)

When vectors are **not at right angles**, use a scale drawing.

**Steps:**
1. Link the vectors **head-to-tail** if not already
2. Draw the resultant vector using the **triangle** or **parallelogram method**
3. Measure the **length** of the resultant vector using a ruler
4. Measure the **angle** of the resultant vector using a protractor

**Important:** Always convert the final answer back to the required units using the given scale (e.g., 1 cm = 1 km).

### Triangle Method

1. Link the vectors **head-to-tail**
2. The resultant vector is formed by connecting the **tail of the first vector** to the **head of the second vector**

### Parallelogram Method

1. Link the vectors **tail-to-tail**
2. Complete the resulting parallelogram
3. The resultant vector is the **diagonal** of the parallelogram

---

## Vector Subtraction

To subtract vectors ($\vec{c} = \vec{a} - \vec{b}$):
1. First **reverse the direction** of vector $\vec{b}$ to make $-\vec{b}$
2. Then add $\vec{a}$ and $-\vec{b}$ using the triangle or parallelogram method

---

## Resolving Vectors

**Resolving** a vector is the opposite of adding vectors — splitting a single resultant vector into two **components** that have the same combined effect.

For a vector $F$ at angle $\theta$ to the horizontal:

| Component | Formula |
|-----------|---------|
| **Horizontal** ($F_x$) | $F_x = F\cos\theta$ |
| **Vertical** ($F_y$) | $F_y = F\sin\theta$ |

**Memory aid:** The $\cos\theta$ component is always the **adjacent** side of the right-angled triangle (the "cos sandwich").

---

## Forces on an Inclined Plane

An **inclined plane** (slope) is a flat surface tilted at an angle $\theta$.

For an object on a slope:
- **Weight** ($W$ or $mg$) acts **vertically downwards**
- **Normal (reaction) force** ($R$) acts **perpendicular** to the slope surface

### Resolving Weight into Components

| Component | Formula | Direction |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Perpendicular to slope** | $W\cos\theta$ or $mg\cos\theta$ | Into the slope |
| **Parallel to slope** | $W\sin\theta$ or $mg\sin\theta$ | Down the slope |

- If no friction, the component $W\sin\theta$ causes the object to accelerate down the slope
- The object is not moving perpendicular to the slope, therefore: $R = W\cos\theta$

---

## Equilibrium

**Equilibrium** occurs when an object is either:
- At **rest**, or
- Moving at **constant velocity**

**Coplanar forces** in equilibrium are represented by **closed vector triangles** (vectors joined together form a closed path).

### Common Forces on Objects

- **Weight**
- **Normal reaction force**
- **Tension** (from cords and strings)
- **Friction**

### Constructing Equilibrium Vector Triangles

1. Draw all the forces on the free-body diagram
2. Remove the object and put all forces coming from a single point
3. Rearrange the forces into a **closed vector triangle**, keeping the same length and direction
4. Ensure the direction of the vectors form a closed path (arrows follow round)

## Key Equations Summary

| Quantity | Equation |
|----------|----------|
| Resultant of perpendicular vectors | $R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ |
| Direction (from horizontal) | $\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$ |
| Horizontal component | $F_x = F\cos\theta$ |
| Vertical component | $F_y = F\sin\theta$ |
| Component parallel to slope | $W\sin\theta$ |
| Component perpendicular to slope | $W\cos\theta$ |

## Exam Tips

- Pythagoras' theorem and trigonometry are consistently used in vector addition — ensure confidence with these mathematical skills.
- When unsure whether to use $\cos\theta$ or $\sin\theta$, remember: $\cos\theta$ is always the **adjacent** side.
- Scale drawing questions may require drawing to scale — have a ruler ready.
- For equilibrium problems, check that the vector triangle **closes** (forms a complete path).
