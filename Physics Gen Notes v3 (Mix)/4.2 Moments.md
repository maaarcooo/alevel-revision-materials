# 4.2 Moments

## Moments

A **moment** is the **turning effect of a force**. Moments occur when forces cause objects to **rotate** about a pivot.

### Moment Equation

$$\text{Moment} = \text{Force} \times \text{Perpendicular distance from the pivot}$$

$$M = F \times d$$

- SI unit: **Newton metres (N m)** or **Newton centimetres (N cm)**
- The distance must be **perpendicular** to the force

### Non-Perpendicular Forces

When the force is not perpendicular to the distance, use the perpendicular component:

$$M = F \times d\cos\theta$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the force direction and the line from the pivot.

### Practical Example

Door handles are placed far from the hinge (pivot) to **maximise** the distance for a given force, providing a greater moment and making the door easier to open.

## The Principle of Moments

**For a system to be in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about a point must be equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments (about the same point).**

$$\sum \text{Clockwise moments} = \sum \text{Anticlockwise moments}$$

For multiple forces:

$$F_2 \times d_2 = (F_1 \times d_1) + (F_3 \times d_3)$$

### Applying the Principle

1. Identify the pivot point
2. Calculate all clockwise moments
3. Calculate all anticlockwise moments
4. Set them equal and solve for the unknown

### Uniform Objects

For uniform objects, the weight acts at the **centre** (midpoint). When calculating moments, measure the distance from the pivot to this centre point.

## Couples

A **couple** is a **pair** of equal and opposite coplanar forces that acts to produce **rotation** only.

### Properties of a Couple

Forces in a couple must be:

- **Equal in magnitude**
- **Opposite in direction**
- **Perpendicular to the distance between them**

### Key Features

- Couples produce a resultant force of **zero**
- Due to Newton's Second Law ($F = ma$), the object does **not accelerate** — it only rotates
- Unlike single-force moments, the moment of a couple **does not depend on a pivot**

### Moment of a Couple

$$\text{Moment of couple} = F \times d$$

where $d$ is the **perpendicular distance between the lines of action of the forces**.

### Important Note

Forces forming a couple **cannot share the same line of action** — there must be a perpendicular separation between them.

## Centre of Mass

The **centre of mass** is **the point at which the weight of the object may be considered to act**.

### Location of Centre of Mass

- For a **uniform regular solid**: at its geometric centre
- For **symmetrical objects with uniform density**: at the **point of symmetry**
- Examples: centre of a sphere, midpoint of a uniform rod, behind the navel for a standing person

### Stability

The position of the centre of mass affects an object's **stability**.

| Base Width | Centre of Mass Height | Stability |
|------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Wider** base | **Lower** centre of mass | More **stable** |
| **Narrower** base | **Higher** centre of mass | Less stable, more likely to topple |

An object is stable when its centre of mass lies **above its base**. If tilted such that the centre of mass moves beyond the base, the object will topple.

### Centre of Gravity vs Centre of Mass

| Property | Centre of Mass | Centre of Gravity |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Depends on gravitational field? | **No** | **Yes** |
| In uniform gravitational field | **Identical** to centre of gravity | **Identical** to centre of mass |

- In a **uniform gravitational field**: centre of gravity = centre of mass
- In a **non-uniform gravitational field** (e.g., in space near a large body): centre of gravity is displaced towards the region of stronger gravitational field

The centre of mass is a hypothetical point — it can lie **inside or outside** a body (e.g., the centre of a ring lies in empty space).

## Key Equations Summary

| Quantity | Equation | Unit |
|----------|----------|------|
| Moment | $M = F \times d$ | N m |
| Moment (non-perpendicular) | $M = F \times d\cos\theta$ | N m |
| Moment of a couple | $M = F \times d$ (between lines of action) | N m |
| Weight | $W = mg$ | N |

## Exam Tips

- Always check that distances are **perpendicular** to forces — use trigonometry if needed
- Ensure all distances use the **same units** before calculating
- For uniform beams/rods, weight acts at the **midpoint**
- When identifying clockwise vs anticlockwise moments, visualise the rotation direction from the pivot
- Not all forces in a diagram contribute to moments — some may be at the pivot or irrelevant
- Draw force diagrams to identify which forces are perpendicular to which distances
