# 4.3 Equations of Motion

## Scalars and Vectors

**Scalar quantities** have magnitude (size) only.
- **Distance**: total length between two points
- **Speed**: total distance travelled per unit time

**Vector quantities** have both magnitude and direction.
- **Displacement**: distance from a fixed point in a specified direction
- **Velocity**: rate of change of displacement
- **Acceleration**: rate of change of velocity

## Instantaneous and Average Speed

**Instantaneous speed/velocity**: speed or velocity at any given point in time.
- On a displacement–time graph: draw a **tangent** to the curve and calculate its **gradient**

**Average speed/velocity**: total distance (or displacement) ÷ total time.
- On a displacement–time graph: total displacement (y-axis) ÷ total time (x-axis)

## Motion Graphs

### Displacement–Time Graphs

| Feature | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| y-intercept | Initial displacement |
| Diagonal straight line | Constant velocity |
| Positive slope | Motion in positive direction |
| Negative slope | Motion in negative direction |
| Horizontal line (zero slope) | Object at rest |
| Curved line | Changing velocity (acceleration) |
| **Gradient** | Velocity |

### Velocity–Time Graphs

| Feature | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Straight line | Uniform acceleration |
| Positive slope | Acceleration in positive direction |
| Negative slope | Acceleration in negative direction |
| Curved line | Non-uniform acceleration |
| Horizontal line | Constant velocity |
| **Gradient** | Acceleration |
| **Area under curve** | Displacement |

### Acceleration–Time Graphs

| Feature | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| y-intercept | Initial acceleration |
| Horizontal line | Constant acceleration |
| **Area under curve** | Change in velocity |

### Key Relationships Between Graphs

- **Gradient** of displacement–time graph = velocity
- **Gradient** of velocity–time graph = acceleration
- **Area under** velocity–time graph = displacement
- **Area under** acceleration–time graph = change in velocity

### Bouncing Ball Analysis

Taking upward as positive:
- Positive velocity when travelling upward
- Negative velocity when travelling downward
- Velocity = 0 at maximum height
- Acceleration = $-9.81 \text{ m s}^{-2}$ (constant, due to gravity acting downward)

## SUVAT Equations

Used for objects moving with **constant acceleration** in a straight line.

### Variables

| Symbol | Quantity | Unit |
|--------|----------|------|
| $s$ | Displacement | m |
| $u$ | Initial velocity | m s⁻¹ |
| $v$ | Final velocity | m s⁻¹ |
| $a$ | Acceleration | m s⁻² |
| $t$ | Time | s |

All quantities are **vectors** — can be positive or negative depending on direction.

### The Four SUVAT Equations

$$v = u + at$$

$$s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$

$$s = \frac{1}{2}(v + u)t$$

$$v^2 = u^2 + 2as$$

### Problem-Solving Strategy

1. List known variables
2. Identify the unknown variable required
3. Select the equation linking known and unknown variables
4. Rearrange and solve algebraically

For two-object problems: analyse each object separately.

## Projectile Motion

**Projectile motion**: motion of an object under the influence of gravity alone (ignoring air resistance).

The object follows a curved path called a **trajectory**.

### Key Features

- **Maximum height**: occurs when vertical velocity component = 0
- At same launch/landing level: maximum height reached at **half the total flight time**
- **Range**: horizontal distance travelled by the projectile

### Component Analysis

Horizontal and vertical components are **independent** of each other.

| | Horizontal Component | Vertical Component |
|---|---|---|
| **Velocity** | Constant | Zero at maximum height |
| **Acceleration** | Zero | $g = 9.8 \text{ m s}^{-2}$ |
| **Displacement** | Range (maximum at end) | Maximum height (at half time) |

### Resolving Velocity Components

For initial velocity $u$ at angle $\theta$ to horizontal:

$$\text{Horizontal component} = u \cos\theta$$

$$\text{Vertical component} = u \sin\theta$$

## Air Resistance and Drag Forces

### Drag Forces

**Drag forces** oppose motion through a fluid (gas or liquid).

Characteristics:
- Act in **opposite direction** to motion
- Never speed up or start motion
- Slow objects down or maintain constant speed
- Convert kinetic energy into heat and sound
- **Increase with speed** of the object

### Air Resistance

**Air resistance** is a drag force experienced when moving through air.

Effects on projectiles:
- Reduces horizontal velocity and range
- Reduces maximum height
- Causes steeper descent gradient

Factors affecting drag through fluids:
- **Larger surface area** → greater air resistance
- **Greater mass** → greater weight

Applications:
- Aircraft fly at high altitude (less dense air → less resistance)
- Cyclists adopt streamlined posture to reduce drag

### Terminal Velocity

As a falling object's speed increases, drag force increases. When **drag force = weight**, acceleration becomes zero and the object falls at constant **terminal velocity**.

For a skydiver:
1. Initially: weight > drag → acceleration downward
2. Speed increases → drag increases
3. When weight = drag → zero acceleration
4. Object falls at constant terminal velocity

## Required Practical: Measuring g by Free Fall

### Aim
Calculate acceleration due to gravity ($g$) by measuring time for a ball-bearing to fall through different heights.

### Equipment

| Equipment | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Metre ruler | Measure distance between light gates |
| Steel ball-bearing | Object to drop (must be magnetic) |
| Electromagnet | Release ball from consistent height |
| Two light gates | Determine time taken to fall |
| Timer | Measure fall time between light gates |
| Clamp stand | Hold glass tube and electromagnet |
| Glass tube | Guide ball vertically |
| Cushion | Protect ball and surface on landing |

### Method

1. Set up apparatus with light gates around glass tube
2. Start with height $h$ ≈ 10 cm between light gates
3. Place cushion underneath to catch ball
4. Switch on electromagnet, place ball underneath
5. Turn off electromagnet to release ball
6. Record time $t$ from timer
7. Repeat at least 3 times for each height; calculate average $t$
8. Increase height in 5 cm increments up to ~50 cm

### Analysis

Starting from $s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$ with $u = 0$:

$$s = \frac{1}{2}at^2$$

Rearranging: $\frac{2s}{t} = at$

**Graph**: Plot $\frac{2h}{t}$ (y-axis) against $t$ (x-axis)

**Gradient = $g$** (acceleration due to gravity)

### Sources of Error

**Systematic errors:**
- Residual magnetism delays release → $t$ recorded longer than actual
- Uncertainty in $h$ from metre ruler (precision ±1 mm)

**Random errors:**
- Ball may not fall through centre of light gates
- Reduced by repeating at least 3 times per height

**Uncertainty in $g$:**
$$\text{Fractional uncertainty} = \frac{\text{gradient of best fit} - \text{gradient of worst fit}}{\text{gradient of best fit}}$$

### Safety Considerations

- High current in electromagnet — keep water away
- Only switch on current when dropping ball (reduce electrocution risk)
- Secure clamp stand with G-clamp for stability
