# 4.4 Newton's Laws of Motion

Newton's laws of motion describe the relationship between the **forces** acting on objects and the **motion** of those objects.

## Newton's First Law

**Newton's First Law** states:

> An object will remain at rest or move with constant velocity unless acted on by a **resultant force**.

This means:
- An object **at rest** will stay at rest unless a resultant force acts on it
- An object moving with **constant velocity** will continue at that velocity unless a resultant force acts on it

A **resultant force** is required to change motion:
- To speed up
- To slow down
- To change direction

### Balanced Forces

If forces on a body are **balanced** (resultant force = 0), the body must be:
- At rest, or
- Moving at constant velocity

Since force is a **vector**, split forces into **horizontal** and **vertical** components:
- Forces left = forces right
- Forces upward = forces downward

The **resultant force** is the **vector sum** of all forces acting on the body.

## Newton's Second Law

**Newton's Second Law** states:

> The resultant force acting on an object with constant mass is directly proportional to its acceleration.

$$F = ma$$

Where:
- $F$ = resultant force (N)
- $m$ = mass (kg)
- $a$ = acceleration (m s⁻²)

### Key Points

- **Acceleration** always acts in the **same direction** as the resultant force
- When **unbalanced forces** act on an object, it experiences a resultant force
- If resultant force acts **along** the direction of motion: object speeds up or slows down
- If resultant force acts at an **angle** to motion: object changes direction

### Resultant Force

**Force** is a **vector** quantity with both **magnitude** and **direction**.

The resultant force is the **vector sum** of all forces acting on the body.

Direction conventions:
- **Positive direction**: direction of motion (for moving objects)
- Forces in direction of motion → positive
- Forces opposing motion → negative

If the resultant force acts at an angle, find magnitude and direction by:
- Combining vectors
- Scale drawings

### Acceleration

**Acceleration** is a **vector** quantity with magnitude and direction.

- Resultant force in direction of motion → **positive acceleration**
- Resultant force opposing motion → **negative acceleration** (deceleration)
- Acceleration always acts in the **same direction** as the resultant force

**Important**: A resultant force opposing motion causes the object to **decelerate**, not suddenly reverse direction.

**Note**: Without drag forces, the acceleration of a falling object is **independent of its mass**.

### Newton's Second Law and Momentum

Newton's second law can also be expressed in terms of **momentum**:

> The resultant force on an object equals its **rate of change of momentum**.

The change in momentum is in the **same direction** as the resultant force.

**Derivation**:

Momentum: $p = mv$

Rate of change of momentum: $\dfrac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = m\dfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$

Force: $F = m\dfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$

Since $a = \dfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$:

$$F = ma$$

## Newton's Third Law

Newton's first and second laws deal with **multiple forces** acting on a **single object**.

Newton's third law deals with forces when **two objects** interact.

**Newton's Third Law** states:

> If Object A exerts a force on Object B, then Object B will exert a force on Object A which is **equal in magnitude** but **opposite in direction**.

### Third-Law Pairs

When two objects interact, forces arise in pairs called **third-law pairs**.

A Newton's third law force pair must be:
- The **same type** of force
- The **same magnitude**
- **Opposite** in direction
- Acting on **different objects**

### Example: Walking

- The **foot** pushes on the **ground** (backward)
- The **ground** pushes on the **foot** (forward)
- Both are **normal contact forces**
- Equal magnitude, opposite direction, different objects

### Common Misconception

Two forces of equal magnitude in opposite directions on the **same object** are **NOT** a third-law pair.

**Example**: Book on a table
- Weight (gravitational pull of Earth on book) acts downward
- Normal contact force (table pushing on book) acts upward

These are **not** a third-law pair because:
- They are **different types** of force (gravitational vs contact)
- They act on the **same object** (the book)

This is an example of **Newton's First Law** (balanced forces, object at rest).

**Actual third-law pairs for the book**:
1. Book pushes table ↔ Table pushes book (normal contact forces)
2. Book pulls Earth ↔ Earth pulls book (gravitational forces)

## Exam Tips

1. **Direction conventions**: Consider direction of motion as positive. Vectors in direction of motion are positive; opposing vectors (e.g., drag) are negative. For stationary objects, choose consistently. Generally: forward, upward, right = positive.

2. **Free-body diagrams**: Show multiple forces on **one object** — relates to Newton's first/second laws, not third law.

3. **Third-law identification**: Use the framework "Object A pushes/pulls Object B, and Object B pushes/pulls Object A" to identify true third-law pairs. Both forces must be the same type.

4. **Balanced forces ≠ Third-law pairs**: Equal and opposite forces on the same object indicate equilibrium (first law), not a third-law pair.

5. **Deceleration**: A resultant force opposing motion causes deceleration, not instant reversal of direction.
