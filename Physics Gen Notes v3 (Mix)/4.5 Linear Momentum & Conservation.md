# 4.5 Linear Momentum & Conservation

## Linear Momentum

**Linear momentum** is the momentum of an object moving in **one dimension**.

$$p = mv$$

Where:
- $p$ = momentum (kg m s⁻¹)
- $m$ = mass (kg)
- $v$ = velocity (m s⁻¹)

Momentum is a **vector** quantity with both **magnitude** and **direction**.
- The initial direction of motion is usually assigned the **positive** direction
- An object travelling in the opposite direction has **negative** velocity and momentum
- A **stationary** object has zero momentum

The linear momentum of an object remains **constant** unless acted upon by an **external resultant force**.

## Conservation of Momentum

**The Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum:**
> The total momentum before a collision is equal to the total momentum after a collision, **provided no external force acts**.

$$p_{Ai} + p_{Bi} = p_{Af} + p_{Bf}$$

Or equivalently:

$$m_A u_A + m_B u_B = m_A v_A + m_B v_B$$

**Key points:**
- **Opposing vectors** can cancel each other out, resulting in a **net momentum of zero**
- An object that **rebounds** has positive velocity before and negative velocity after collision
- Momentum is **always conserved** (like energy)

### External and Internal Forces

| Force Type | Definition | Examples |
|------------|------------|----------|
| **External forces** | Forces acting on a system from outside | Friction, weight |
| **Internal forces** | Forces exchanged by particles within the system | Tension in a string |

Systems with no external forces are described as **'closed'** or **'isolated'** — in these systems, total momentum is conserved.

**Example:** A swimmer diving from a boat — the diver moves forwards, and the boat moves backwards to conserve momentum.

## Impulse

**Force** can be defined as the **rate of change of momentum**:

$$F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$

**Impulse** is the product of **force** and **time** for which it acts:

$$\text{Impulse} = F \Delta t = \Delta p = mv - mu$$

Where:
- Impulse is measured in **newton seconds (N s)**
- $F$ = resultant force (N)
- $\Delta t$ = time over which force acts (s)
- $\Delta p$ = change in momentum (kg m s⁻¹)

**Key properties:**
- Impulse is a **vector** quantity with magnitude and direction
- Impulse is always in the direction of the **resultant force**
- A **small force over a long time** has the same effect as a **large force over a short time**
- These equations apply only when force $F$ is **constant**

### Examples of Impulse

**Rain vs Hail:** Hailstones bounce back off an umbrella (greater change in momentum) while raindrops splatter and roll off (smaller change in momentum). More force is required to hold an umbrella upright in hail.

**Catching a cricket ball:** A fielder moves their hands **backwards** when catching to **increase the time** for the change in momentum, thereby **reducing the force** on their hands and preventing injury.

## Impulse on a Force-Time Graph

When force is **not constant**, the **impulse equals the area under the force-time graph**.

This is because: Impulse = Force × Change in time

**Finding the area:**
- If the graph is a **curve** — count squares underneath
- If the graph is **straight lines** — split into sections (triangles, rectangles, trapeziums) and sum the areas

The same change in momentum over a **longer period** produces **less force** (and vice versa).

## Collisions: Elastic and Inelastic

In all collisions and explosions, **momentum is always conserved**.

However, **kinetic energy** may or may not be conserved:

| Collision Type | Kinetic Energy | Typical Behaviour |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Elastic** | Conserved | Objects move in **opposite directions** after collision |
| **Inelastic** | Not conserved | Objects **stick together** after collision |

**Kinetic energy equation:**

$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

To determine collision type: **compare kinetic energy before and after** the collision.

**Explosions** (e.g., gun recoil, radioactive decay) — momentum is conserved; objects move in opposite directions.

**Note:** If an object is stationary, its velocity = 0, so momentum and kinetic energy = 0. For objects that stick together, treat as a single object with combined mass.

## Impact Forces and Safety Features

**Impact forces are reduced by increasing the contact time** over which the collision occurs.

$$F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$

For a given impulse, increasing $\Delta t$ decreases $F$.

### Vehicle Safety Features

| Feature | How it works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Seat belts** | Keep passenger fixed to seat; stretch slightly to **increase contact time**, reducing force during collision |
| **Airbags** | Deploy as soft cushion; **increase contact time** over which passenger's momentum changes |
| **Crumple zones** | Located at front and back of vehicle; designed to **crush in a controlled way**, increasing time for momentum to reach zero |

**On a force-time graph:** Increased contact time shown by a **lower peak** and **wider base** for the same area (same impulse).

### Applications in Sport

- **Catching a cricket ball:** Move hands backwards to increase time, reduce force
- **Kicking a football:** Follow-through action increases contact time, creating larger impulse and higher ball velocity

## Exam Tips

- **Direction matters:** Assign positive direction at the start; objects moving opposite have negative velocity
- **Unit conversions:** Convert mass to kg (÷1000 if in grams); convert velocity to m s⁻¹
- **Rebounding objects:** Change in momentum = $mv - mu$ where $v$ is negative if direction reverses
- **Base units:** 1 N = 1 kg m s⁻², so N s = kg m s⁻¹ (impulse and momentum have same units)
- **Stationary objects:** Have zero momentum and zero kinetic energy
- **Stuck-together collisions:** Use combined mass $(m_A + m_B)$ for final momentum calculation
