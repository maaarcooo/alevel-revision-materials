# 4.6 Work, Energy & Power

## Work Done

**Work done** by a force is equivalent to a **transfer of energy**.

- Unit of work done: newton metres (N m)
- $1 \text{ N m} = 1 \text{ J}$

**Mechanical work** is defined as the amount of energy transferred when an external force causes an object to move over a certain distance.

The work done by a **resultant force** on a system equals the change in energy in that system.

### Work Done Equations

For a constant force **parallel** to displacement:

$$W = Fs$$

Where:
- $W$ = work done (J)
- $F$ = average force applied (N)
- $s$ = displacement (m)

For a force at an angle $\theta$ to displacement:

$$W = Fs \cos \theta$$

- When $\theta = 0°$: $\cos \theta = 1$, so $W = Fs$
- For **horizontal motion**: use $\cos \theta$
- For **vertical motion**: use $\sin \theta$
- The **component** of force **parallel to the displacement** is what does work

### Work Done Against Friction

When pushing an object, **work is done against friction** and energy transfers from the person to the object. Some energy is **dissipated** to surroundings as heat and sound.

## Power

**Power** is the rate of doing **work** or the rate of **energy transfer**.

$$P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}$$

Where:
- $P$ = power (W)
- $\Delta W$ = change in work done (J)
- $\Delta t$ = change in time (s)

Power increases if:
- Greater energy transfer (work done)
- Energy transferred over a shorter time

### Power at Constant Velocity

For an object moving at **constant velocity** with a **constant force**:

$$P = Fv$$

Where:
- $F$ = force (N)
- $v$ = velocity (m s⁻¹)

The force **must** be in the direction of velocity. Otherwise, use the **component** of force in the direction of velocity.

## Area Under a Force-Displacement Graph

For a **variable force** (non-constant), work done cannot be calculated using $W = Fs$.

**Work done = Area under the force-displacement graph**

This works because: Work done = Force × Displacement

The same work is done by:
- A **small force** over a **long displacement**
- A **large force** over a **small displacement**

**Method**: Split the graph into geometric sections (rectangles, triangles, trapeziums) and sum the areas.

### Variable Forces

A **variable force** is more representative of real-life situations.

- If force is **constant**: use $W = Fs$ and $P = Fv$
- If force is **varying**: find work from area under force-displacement graph
- If varying force increases → acceleration increases (and vice versa)

## Efficiency

**Efficiency** measures how successfully energy is transferred in a system.

**Definition**: The ratio of the useful power output from a system to its total power input.

- **High efficiency**: most energy transferred is **useful**
- **Low efficiency**: most energy transferred is **wasted**

### Efficiency Equations

$$\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Useful power output}}{\text{Total power input}} \times 100\%$$

Or in terms of energy:

$$\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Useful energy output}}{\text{Total energy input}} \times 100\%$$

Where: $\text{Power} = \frac{\text{Energy}}{\text{Time}}$

### Useful vs Wasted Energy

What counts as useful or wasted depends on the system:
- **Light bulb**: light energy is useful, heat is **wasted**
- **Heater**: thermal energy is useful, sound is **wasted**

**Note**: Efficiency can be expressed as a ratio (0 to 1) or percentage (0% to 100%). Efficiency has **no units**.

## Conservation of Energy

### The Principle of Conservation of Energy

> **Energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be transferred from one form to another.**

The total energy in a **closed system** remains constant, though the distribution between forms may change.

### Types of Energy

| Form | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Kinetic** | Energy of a moving object |
| **Gravitational Potential** | Energy gained when lifted, lost when falling |
| **Elastic** | Energy of a stretched spring or elastic band (strain energy) |
| **Chemical** | Energy contained in a chemical substance |
| **Nuclear** | Energy contained within the nucleus of an atom |
| **Internal (Thermal)** | Energy due to temperature/state |

### Energy Dissipation

- No energy transfer is **100% efficient**
- Some energy is always **dissipated** to surroundings
- **Dissipated energy** = wasted energy (cannot easily be used)
- Common wasted forms: **thermal (heat), light, or sound** energy

### Common Energy Transfers

- Falling object (in vacuum): GPE → KE
- Battery: Chemical energy → Electrical energy
- Horizontal mass on spring: Elastic PE → KE
- Trampoline: Elastic PE ↔ KE ↔ GPE

### Work Done Against Friction

For an object travelling up a rough inclined surface:

$$\text{Loss in KE} = \text{Gain in GPE} + \text{Work done against friction}$$

---

## Kinetic Energy

**Kinetic energy** is the energy an object has due to its **motion** (or velocity).

- Faster object → greater kinetic energy
- Falling object **gains** KE (from GPE)

$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

Where:
- $E_k$ = kinetic energy (J)
- $m$ = mass (kg)
- $v$ = velocity (m s⁻¹)

**Note**: Only speed is squared, not mass or the ½.

---

## Gravitational Potential Energy

**Gravitational potential energy (GPE)** is energy stored in a mass due to its position in a gravitational field.

- Mass **lifted up** → **gains** GPE
- Mass **falls** → **loses** GPE

For a **uniform gravitational field** (near Earth's surface):

$$\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$$

Where:
- $\Delta E_p$ = change in gravitational potential energy (J)
- $m$ = mass (kg)
- $g$ = gravitational field strength (9.81 N kg⁻¹)
- $\Delta h$ = change in height (m)

### Key Points

- GPE at ground level is usually taken as **zero** (any reference point can be used)
- This equation only applies near Earth's surface (uniform field)
- GPE and height have a **linear relationship** (straight-line graph)

| Power (constant velocity) | $P = Fv$ | W |
| Efficiency | $\eta = \frac{\text{useful output}}{\text{total input}} \times 100\%$ | % |

| Gravitational PE | $\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$ | J |
| Elastic PE | $E_{elastic} = \frac{1}{2}k(\Delta L)^2$ | J |

## Exam Tips

1. **Force direction**: Ensure the force used is **parallel** to displacement. Resolve forces if needed.

2. **Graph areas**: Check units on axes. Convert kN to N and km to m before calculating work done.

3. **Sketching graphs**: Don't need to be to scale, but label key values on axes.

4. **Energy conservation**: Identify energy transfers in the system — GPE ↔ KE is common.

5. **Efficiency**: Can be ratio (decimal) or percentage — read the question carefully.

6. **Kinetic energy**: Only $v$ is squared, not $m$ or ½. "Loss of KE" should not include a negative sign (energy is scalar).

7. **GPE equation**: Only valid for uniform gravitational fields (near Earth's surface). Use correct symbol $\Delta E_p$.
