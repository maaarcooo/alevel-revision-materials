# 4.7 Bulk Properties of Solids

## Density

**Density** is the mass per unit volume of an object.

$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$

- $\rho$ = density (kg m⁻³)
- $m$ = mass (kg)
- $V$ = volume (m³)

Low-density materials typically have lower mass. Gases are less dense than solids because their particles are more spread out.

**Unit conversions:**
- 1 mm = 1 × 10⁻³ m
- 1 mm³ = 1 × 10⁻⁹ m³

## Hooke's Law

The **extension** of a material is directly proportional to the applied force up to the **limit of proportionality**.

$$F = k\Delta L$$

- $F$ = force (N)
- $k$ = **spring constant** (N m⁻¹)
- $\Delta L$ = extension (m)

**Key definitions:**
- **Spring constant** — measures the stiffness of a spring. Higher $k$ = stiffer spring.
- **Extension** = stretched length − unstretched length
- **Compression** — decrease in length under load

### Force-Extension Graphs

- Straight line through the origin indicates Hooke's Law is obeyed (extension ∝ force).
- **Gradient** of force-extension graph = spring constant $k$
- Gradient of extension-force graph = $\frac{1}{k}$
- Beyond the **limit of proportionality**, extension is no longer proportional to force.

## Tensile Stress and Strain

### Tensile Stress

**Tensile stress** is the force exerted per unit cross-sectional area.

$$\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$$

- $\sigma$ = tensile stress (Pa or N m⁻²)
- $F$ = force (N)
- $A$ = cross-sectional area (m²)

**Ultimate tensile stress (UTS)** — the maximum force per original cross-sectional area a wire can withstand before breaking.

### Tensile Strain

**Tensile strain** is the deformation of a solid due to stress (elongation or contraction).

$$\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$$

- $\varepsilon$ = tensile strain (no units — it's a ratio)
- $\Delta L$ = extension (m)
- $L$ = original length (m)

Strain may be expressed as a percentage.

## Stress-Strain Curves

Each material has a unique stress-strain curve. Key points on the graph:

| Point | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| **Limit of Proportionality** | Stress is no longer proportional to strain (Hooke's Law stops applying) |
| **Elastic Limit** | Maximum stress before permanent deformation occurs |
| **Yield Stress** | Stress at which material extends plastically with no/small increase in stress |
| **Ultimate Tensile Stress (UTS)** | Maximum stress the material can withstand |
| **Breaking Stress** | Stress at which the material fractures (final point on graph) |

### Elastic vs Plastic Deformation

| Type | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **Elastic deformation** | Material returns to original shape when force removed (reversible) |
| **Plastic deformation** | Permanent deformation — material does not return to original shape |

- **Elastic region** — extension proportional to force; before elastic limit
- **Plastic region** — beyond elastic limit; ends at fracture

## Elastic Strain Energy

Work done stretching a material is stored as **elastic potential energy (EPE)**.

**Work done = area under force-extension graph**

For materials obeying Hooke's Law (triangular area):

$$E = \frac{1}{2}F\Delta L = \frac{1}{2}k(\Delta L)^2$$

- $E$ = elastic strain energy (J)
- $F$ = force (N)
- $\Delta L$ = extension (m)
- $k$ = spring constant (N m⁻¹)

For non-Hooke's Law materials: calculate area by dividing into segments or counting squares.

### Energy in a Spring-Mass System

Energy converts between three forms:

| Position | Energy Distribution |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Top (A)** | GPE maximum, some EPE (spring compressed) |
| **Equilibrium (B)** | KE maximum (maximum speed), some EPE and GPE |
| **Bottom (C)** | EPE maximum (maximum extension) |

## Brittle and Ductile Materials

| Material Type | Behaviour | Graph Characteristics |
|--------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Brittle** | Breaks with little elastic deformation, negligible plastic deformation | Straight line through origin, fractures with no/minimal plastic region |
| **Ductile** | Stretches significantly before breaking (plastic deformation) | Straight line through origin, curves into plastic region before fracture |

Example: Copper is ductile — suitable for making wires.

**UTS and breaking stress** depend on material conditions (e.g., temperature). Engineers must account for extreme temperatures and loads in design.

## Loading and Unloading

### Metal Wire

When stretched beyond the limit of proportionality:
- **Plastic deformation** occurs
- Area between loading and unloading curves = work done to permanently deform material
- **Permanent extension** remains when force is removed

### Rubber Band (Hysteresis)

Rubber bands exhibit **hysteresis** — loading and unloading curves differ.

- Rubber returns to original length (elastic behaviour)
- More strain energy stored during loading than released during unloading
- Unloading curve is always below loading curve

**Area interpretation:**
- **Area X** = work done heating the rubber (thermal energy)
- **Area Y** = work done by rubber returning to original shape
- **Area X + Y** = total work done stretching the rubber

Rubber becomes warm when stretched and contracted — energy dissipated as thermal energy.

## Shock Absorbers

**Function:** Absorb/dampen compression and rebound of springs in vehicle suspension systems.

**Purpose:**
- Reduce vibrations from road bumps, potholes, and speed bumps
- Prevent damage to vehicle
- Improve passenger comfort
- Keep tyres in contact with road

Shock absorbers are elastic objects that convert kinetic energy into other forms (mainly thermal).
