# 4.8 The Young Modulus

## Key Concepts

**Young Modulus** ($E$): A measure of a material's ability to withstand changes in length under an applied load. It quantifies the **stiffness** of a material.

The Young Modulus is defined as the **ratio of tensile stress to tensile strain**:

$$E = \frac{\text{Tensile Stress}}{\text{Tensile Strain}} = \frac{FL}{A\Delta L}$$

Where:
- $F$ = force (N)
- $L$ = original length (m)
- $A$ = cross-sectional area (m²)
- $\Delta L$ = extension (m)

**Units**: Pascals (Pa) — since strain is dimensionless, Young Modulus has the same units as stress.

**Typical values**: Very large numbers, typically in the order of **GPa** (10⁹ Pa).

## Young's Modulus Values for Common Materials

| Material | Young's Modulus / GPa |
|----------|----------------------|
| Aluminium | 70 |
| Copper | 117 |
| Brass | 120 |
| Iron | 170 |
| Nickel | 210 |
| Steel | 110 |

## Young Modulus from Stress-Strain Graphs

The Young Modulus equals the **gradient** of a stress-strain graph in the **linear region** (where Hooke's Law is obeyed).

$$E = \frac{\Delta \sigma}{\Delta \varepsilon} = \text{gradient of linear region}$$

The **area under the graph** in the linear region equals the **energy stored per unit volume** of the material.

**Exam Tip**: To remember the equation order, use: *"When you're stressed, you show the strain"* — Stress ÷ Strain.

## Required Practical: Measuring the Young Modulus

### Aim
Measure the Young Modulus of a metal wire using a clamped horizontal wire over a pulley (or vertical wire attached to ceiling).

### Variables
- **Independent**: Force/load (N)
- **Dependent**: Extension (m)
- **Control**: Original wire length, wire thickness, metal type

### Equipment

| Equipment | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Bench | Hold equipment |
| G-clamp | Stabilise apparatus |
| Copper wire | Test material |
| Metre ruler (resolution: 1 mm) | Measure length and extension |
| Pulley | Allow mass to hang vertically, reduce friction |
| Tape marker | Mark reference point for extension measurement |
| Wooden blocks | Clamp wire taut and straight |
| Mass hanger + 100 g masses | Apply load to create extension |
| Micrometer (resolution: 0.001 mm) | Measure wire diameter |

### Method

1. Measure wire **diameter** with micrometer — take at least **3 readings** and find average
2. Set up apparatus with wire taut, **no masses** on hanger initially
3. Measure **original length** with metre ruler; mark reference point with tape (e.g. at 1 cm)
4. Record initial ruler reading at reference point
5. Add 100 g mass to hanger
6. Record new tape marker position
7. Repeat, adding 100 g each time (at least 5–10 readings)

### Analysis

1. **Calculate cross-sectional area**:
$$A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}$$

2. **Plot graph** of load ($F$) against extension ($\Delta L$)
   - Load = mass × $g$ (9.81 N kg⁻¹)

3. **Determine gradient** of force-extension graph:
$$\text{Gradient} = \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta L}$$

4. **Calculate Young Modulus**:
$$E = \text{gradient} \times \frac{L}{A}$$

This derives from rearranging the Young Modulus equation:
$$F = \left(\frac{E \times A}{L}\right) \Delta L$$

Comparing with $y = mx$: gradient = $(E \times A)/L$

### Evaluating the Experiment

**Systematic Errors**:
- Use a **vernier scale** for more precise extension readings
- If wire extends past **elastic limit**, it will be permanently deformed — check wire returns to original length after removing load before taking new readings

**Random Errors**:
- **Parallax error** when reading marker on ruler
- Reduce by **repeating** for all loads and finding average extension
- Measure diameter in **several places** and calculate average to reduce uncertainty in cross-sectional area

### Safety Considerations

- Wear **safety goggles** at all times (wire may snap)
- Place **cushion or soft surface** below mass hanger (masses may fall)

## Key Equations Summary

| Quantity | Equation |
|----------|----------|
| Young Modulus | $E = \frac{FL}{A\Delta L}$ |
| Tensile stress | $\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$ |
| Tensile strain | $\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$ |
| Cross-sectional area | $A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}$ |
| Young Modulus from graph | $E = \text{gradient} \times \frac{L}{A}$ |

## Worked Example Approach

When calculating Young Modulus from given data:

1. Write the Young Modulus equation: $E = \frac{\text{stress}}{\text{strain}} = \frac{FL}{A\Delta L}$
2. Calculate **stress**: $\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$ (convert mm² to m²: 1 mm² = 1 × 10⁻⁶ m²)
3. Calculate **strain**: $\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$ (if given as percentage, convert: 0.50% = 0.005)
4. Divide stress by strain to obtain Young Modulus

## Exam Tips

- Always convert units to SI (mm to m, mm² to m²)
- For stress-strain graphs, only use the **linear region** to find gradient
- Young Modulus values are typically 10⁹ to 10¹¹ Pa — check your answer is sensible
- In practicals, suggest improvements: repeat readings, use longer wire, use vernier scale
