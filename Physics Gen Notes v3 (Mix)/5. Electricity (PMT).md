# 5. Electricity

## 5.1 Basics of Electricity

### Current, Charge and Time

**Electric current (I)** is the rate of flow of charge in a circuit.

$$I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$$

where $Q$ is charge (C) and $t$ is time (s). Current is measured in amperes (A).

### Potential Difference

**Potential difference (V)** is the energy transferred per unit charge between two points in a circuit.

$$V = \frac{W}{Q}$$

where $W$ is energy transferred (J) and $Q$ is charge (C). P.d. is measured in volts (V).

### Resistance

**Resistance (R)** is a measure of how difficult it is for current to flow through a material. It is calculated by dividing the potential difference across a component by the current flowing through it.

$$R = \frac{V}{I}$$

Resistance is measured in ohms (Ω).

### Measuring Instruments

**Ammeter**: Measures current in the circuit loop it is connected in series with. An ideal ammeter has **zero resistance**.

**Voltmeter**: Measures potential difference across components. An ideal voltmeter has **infinite resistance** (no current flows through it).

## 5.2 Current-Voltage Characteristics

### Ohm's Law

**Ohm's Law** states that for an **ohmic conductor**, current is directly proportional to the potential difference across it, provided physical conditions (e.g. temperature) remain **constant**.

The constant of proportionality is resistance: $V = IR$

### I-V Characteristics of Components

**Ohmic conductor**: Follows Ohm's law. I-V graph is a straight line through the origin (under constant physical conditions).

**Semiconductor diode**: 
- **Forward bias**: Direction allowing current to flow easily past the **threshold voltage** (minimum voltage needed to allow current flow)
- **Reverse bias**: Extremely high resistance; only very small current can flow
- I-V graph shows exponential increase in forward bias, near-zero current in reverse bias

**Filament lamp**: Contains a metal wire that **heats up as current increases**, causing resistance to increase with current.
- At low currents: Ohm's law is obeyed (wire doesn't heat significantly)
- At higher currents: Graph curves due to increasing resistance
- Symmetrical behaviour for positive and negative current

## 5.3 Resistivity

### Definition and Formula

**Resistivity (ρ)** is a measure of how easily a material conducts electricity. It is defined as the product of resistance and cross-sectional area, divided by length.

$$\rho = \frac{RA}{L}$$

where:
- $\rho$ = resistivity (Ω m)
- $R$ = resistance (Ω)
- $A$ = cross-sectional area (m²)
- $L$ = length (m)

Resistivity gives the resistance of a material of length 1 m and cross-sectional area 1 m², useful for comparing different materials.

### Temperature Effects on Metals

When temperature of a **metal conductor increases**, its **resistance increases**.

**Explanation**: Metal atoms gain kinetic energy and vibrate more. Charge carriers (electrons) collide with atoms more frequently, slowing them down. Current decreases, so resistance increases (as $R = V/I$).

### Thermistors

**Thermistor**: A temperature-sensitive semiconductor whose **resistance increases when temperature decreases**.

**Explanation**: Increasing temperature causes electrons to be emitted from atoms, increasing the number of charge carriers. Current increases, so resistance decreases.

**Application**: Temperature sensors that trigger events when temperature reaches a specific value (e.g. turning on heating when room temperature drops below a threshold).

### Light Dependent Resistors

**Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)**: A light-sensitive semiconductor whose **resistance increases when light intensity decreases**.

### Superconductors

**Superconductor**: A material with **zero resistivity** when temperature is at or below the **critical temperature**.

- Critical temperature depends on the material
- Most known superconductors have critical temperatures close to 0 K (−273°C)

**Applications of superconductors**:
- **Power cables**: Zero energy loss through heating during transmission
- **Strong magnetic fields**: No constant power source required; used in maglev trains (no friction between train and rail) and medical applications (e.g. MRI scanners)

## 5.4 Circuits

### Series Circuits

**Series circuits**: Components connected end to end (in one loop).

Properties:
- **Current is the same** everywhere in the circuit
- **P.d. is shared** across all elements (total sum of voltages equals supply p.d.)
- Total resistance: $R_T = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ...$

### Parallel Circuits

**Parallel circuits**: Components connected across each other (separate loops).

Properties:
- **Sum of currents** in each branch equals the total current
- **P.d. across each branch is the same**
- Total resistance: $\frac{1}{R_T} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + ...$

### Combining Cells

**Cells in series**: Total voltage equals sum of individual voltages.
$$V_T = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + ...$$

**Identical cells in parallel**: Total voltage equals voltage of one cell (current splits equally between branches).
$$V_T = V_1 = V_2 = V_3 = ...$$

### Kirchhoff's Laws

In DC circuits, charge and energy are **always conserved**.

**Kirchhoff's First Law**: The total current flowing into a junction equals the current flowing out. (Conservation of charge)

**Kirchhoff's Second Law**: The sum of all voltages in a series circuit equals the battery voltage. (Conservation of energy)

### Power

**Power (P)** is the rate of transfer of energy.

$$P = \frac{E}{t}$$

where $E$ is energy (J) and $t$ is time (s). Power is measured in watts (W).

Using $V = IR$, power can be expressed as:

$$P = VI = \frac{V^2}{R} = I^2R$$

Energy transferred:
$$E = VIt$$

## 5.5 Potential Divider

**Potential divider**: A circuit with several resistors in series connected across a voltage source, used to produce a required fraction of the source p.d.

For two resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ in series:

$$V_{out} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \times V_{in}$$

### Variable Potential Divider

Using a **variable resistor** allows the output p.d. to be varied:
- If resistance across $R_1$ increases → circuit current decreases → output p.d. decreases

### Sensor Circuits

Replacing the variable resistor with a **thermistor** or **LDR** creates temperature or light sensor circuits:

**LDR sensor example**:
- Light intensity falls → LDR resistance increases → circuit current decreases → p.d. across $R_2$ decreases
- Swapping positions of LDR and resistor reverses the effect (p.d. out increases as light decreases)

These sensors can trigger events when a **threshold voltage** is reached (e.g. switching on a light when it gets dark).

## 5.6 Electromotive Force and Internal Resistance

### Internal Resistance

**Internal resistance (r)**: The resistance to the flow of charge within a source. Caused by electrons colliding with atoms inside the battery, resulting in energy being dissipated within the source before electrons leave.

### Electromotive Force

**Electromotive force (emf, ε)**: The energy transferred by a source to each unit of charge that passes through it.

$$\varepsilon = \frac{E}{Q}$$

Emf is measured in volts (V).

### Circuit Equations

Total resistance in circuit:
$$R_T = R + r$$

where $R$ is load resistance and $r$ is internal resistance.

Emf equation:
$$\varepsilon = I(R + r) = IR + Ir$$

**Terminal potential difference (V)**: The p.d. across the terminals of the power source (across load resistance $R$).
$$V = IR$$

**Lost volts (v)**: The p.d. across the internal resistance; equal to energy wasted by the cell per coulomb of charge.
$$v = Ir$$

Therefore:
$$\varepsilon = V + v$$

### Measuring EMF

The emf of a battery can be measured by measuring the voltage across the cell using a voltmeter when there is **no current** flowing (open circuit).
