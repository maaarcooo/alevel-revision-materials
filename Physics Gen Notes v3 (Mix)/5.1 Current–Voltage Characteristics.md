# 5.1 Current–Voltage Characteristics

## Electric Current

**Electric current** is defined as the **rate of flow of electric charge**.

$$I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$$

Where:
- $I$ = current (A)
- $\Delta Q$ = charge flowing (C)
- $\Delta t$ = time interval (s)

**Units**: Current is measured in **amperes (A)**. 1 A = 1 C s⁻¹ (one coulomb per second).

**Current flow requirements**:
- A **conductor** through which current can flow
- A source of **potential difference**
- A complete circuit connecting the positive and negative terminals

**Conventional current** flows from the **positive** terminal to the **negative** terminal. This is the **opposite** direction to **electron flow** (electrons flow from negative to positive as they are **negatively** charged).

**Measuring current**: Use an **ammeter** connected in **series** with the component.

## Potential Difference

**Potential difference** is defined as the **electrical work done per unit charge flowing between two points**.

$$V = \frac{W}{Q}$$

Where:
- $V$ = potential difference (V)
- $W$ = electrical work done (J)
- $Q$ = charge flow (C)

**Units**: Measured in **volts (V)**. 1 V = 1 J C⁻¹ (one joule per coulomb).

**How cells create potential difference**: A cell creates potential difference through **separation of charge** — one **terminal** has excess **positive** charge, the other has excess **negative** charge. Electrons are **repelled** by the negative terminal and **attracted** to the positive terminal, **causing** current to flow.

**Energy transfer**:
- Electrons **gain** energy as they flow through a cell
- Electrons **lose** energy as they flow through circuit components
- Example: In a 12 V cell, each coulomb gains 12 J passing through the cell, then transfers 12 J to the circuit

**Measuring potential difference**: Use a **voltmeter** connected in **parallel** with the component.

## Resistance

**Resistance** is defined as the **opposition of a component to the flow of electric current through it**.

$$R = \frac{V}{I}$$

Where:
- $R$ = resistance (Ω)
- $V$ = potential difference (V)
- $I$ = current (A)

**Units**: Measured in **ohms (Ω)**. 1 Ω corresponds to 1 V producing 1 A of current.

**Effect of resistance on current** (at constant p.d.):
- **Higher** resistance → **lower** current
- **Lower** resistance → **higher** current

All electrical components have some resistance. Wires are made from copper due to its **low** electrical resistance (**good conductor**).

> **Exam note**: In exam questions, the resistance of wires is taken to be **zero**.

## Ohm's Law

**Ohm's law** states: **For a conductor at a constant temperature, the current through it is proportional to the potential difference across it.**

$$V = IR$$

**Constant temperature** implies **constant resistance**.

**Testing Ohm's law**: Use a circuit with a fixed resistor, variable resistor, ammeter (series) and voltmeter (parallel). Adjust the variable resistor to vary current and p.d., then plot an I–V graph.

**Obeying Ohm's law**: A component obeys Ohm's law if its I–V graph is a **straight line through the origin**.
- A **resistor** obeys Ohm's law
- A **filament lamp** does **not** obey Ohm's law

**Finding resistance from I–V graph**: For a graph of current (y-axis) against potential difference (x-axis), resistance = **1 ÷ gradient**.

## I–V Characteristics

### Ohmic Conductor (Resistor)

**Graph shape**: **Straight line through the origin**

**Behaviour**: Current is **directly proportional** to potential difference. Resistance remains **constant**.

### Semiconductor Diode

**Graph shape**: Horizontal line on the left (negative V), then curves **sharply upwards** on the right (positive V)

**Behaviour**:
- **Forward bias**: Current flows in the direction of the arrowhead symbol — sharp increase in current above a threshold voltage
- **Reverse bias**: Diode is switched around and **does not conduct** — zero current regardless of voltage

**Function**: Allows current to flow in **one direction only**.

### Filament Lamp

**Graph shape**: **'S' shaped curve** — starts linear then curves, flattening at higher voltages

**Behaviour**: Current increases at a **proportionally slower rate** than potential difference.

**Explanation**:
1. As current increases, the **temperature** of the filament **increases**
2. Since the filament is a metal, higher temperature causes an **increase in resistance**
3. Resistance opposes current, causing current to **increase at a slower rate**

**Key points**:
- Where the graph is a straight line → resistance is **constant**
- Where the graph curves → resistance **increases**
- The filament lamp obeys Ohm's law **only for small voltages**

## Exam Tips

- **Potential difference ≠ energy**: P.d. is energy *per unit charge*. Two batteries with the same voltage may store different total energies.
- **Ammeter**: Always in **series**.
- **Voltmeter**: Always in **parallel**.
- **Gradient interpretation**: On an I–V graph, gradient = 1/R. Increasing gradient means decreasing resistance; decreasing gradient means increasing resistance.
- Be confident sketching I–V characteristics from memory — this is commonly examined.
