# 5.2 Resistance & Resistivity

## Resistivity

### Origin of Resistance

All materials have some **resistance** to the flow of charge. As **free electrons move** through a metal wire, they collide with **ions** which get in their way. On **collision**, they **transfer** some or all of their **kinetic energy**, causing electrical **heating**.

Since **current** is the **flow** of **charge**, the ions resisting their flow causes **resistance**.

### Factors Affecting Resistance

Resistance depends on:
- **Length** of the wire
- **Cross-sectional area** through which current passes
- **Resistivity** of the material

### Resistance Equation

$$R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$$

Where:
- $R$ = resistance (Ω)
- $\rho$ = resistivity (Ω m)
- $L$ = length (m)
- $A$ = cross-sectional area (m²)

**Key relationships:**
- The **longer** the wire, the **greater** its resistance
- The **thicker** the wire, the **smaller** its resistance
- Doubling the length doubles the resistance
- Doubling the cross-sectional area halves the resistance

### Resistivity

**Resistivity** is a property that describes the extent to which a material opposes the flow of electric current through it.

- It is a property of the **material** itself
- It is **dependent on temperature**
- Measured in **Ω m**

**Typical resistivity values at room temperature:**

| Category | Material | Resistivity (Ω m) |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Metals** | Copper | $1.7 \times 10^{-8}$ |
| | Gold | $2.4 \times 10^{-8}$ |
| | Aluminium | $2.6 \times 10^{-8}$ |
| **Semiconductors** | Germanium | 0.6 |
| | Silicon | $2.3 \times 10^{3}$ |
| **Insulators** | Glass | $10^{12}$ |
| | Sulfur | $10^{15}$ |

- The **higher** the resistivity, the **higher** its resistance
- Copper's low resistivity makes it ideal for electrical wires
- Insulators have such high resistivity that virtually no current flows through them

### Cross-Sectional Area for Circular Wires

$$A = \pi r^2 = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}$$

**Important:** If the diameter doubles, the area quadruples, causing resistance to drop by a quarter.

## Resistance in a Thermistor

### Temperature and Resistance in Metals

All solids are made of **vibrating atoms**. The higher the temperature, the faster these atoms vibrate.

**Electric current** is the flow of free electrons in a material. Electrons collide with vibrating atoms, which impede their flow, causing current to **decrease**.

For a **metallic conductor** obeying Ohm's law (using $V = IR$):
- An **increase** in temperature causes an **increase** in resistance
- A **decrease** in temperature causes a **decrease** in resistance

### Thermistors

A **thermistor** is a **non-ohmic conductor** and sensory resistor whose resistance varies with temperature.

Most thermistors are **negative temperature coefficient (NTC)** components:
- If temperature **increases**, resistance **decreases**
- If temperature **decreases**, resistance **increases**

This is the **opposite** behaviour to metallic conductors.

### Applications of Thermistors

Thermistors are temperature sensors used in:
- Ovens
- Fire alarms
- Digital thermometers

### Thermistor in a Series Circuit

When a thermistor is connected in series with a resistor R:
- If temperature decreases → thermistor resistance increases → total resistance increases → current decreases
- The p.d. across the thermistor increases (from $V = IR$)
- The p.d. across R decreases (thermistor receives a greater proportion of the cell's emf)

## Superconductivity

### Key Definitions

**Superconductor:** A material with **no resistance** below a **critical temperature**.

**Critical temperature** (or **transition temperature**): The temperature at which a material becomes superconducting.

### Properties

- All materials have some resistivity, even good conductors like copper and silver
- Resistance causes electrical energy to be wasted as thermal energy (heating)
- Lowering temperature reduces resistivity
- Below the critical temperature, resistivity **disappears entirely**

**Example:** Mercury has a critical temperature of **4.2 K**

### Resistivity vs Temperature Graph

For a normal metal: resistivity decreases gradually with decreasing temperature but never reaches zero.

For a superconductor: resistivity drops sharply to **zero** at the critical temperature $T_c$.

### Applications of Superconductors

Superconductors are useful for applications requiring **large electric currents**:

| Application | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| MRI scanners | Strong magnetic fields for medical imaging |
| Transformers & generators | Reduced energy loss, fewer fire risks |
| Motors | High efficiency |
| Maglev trains | Magnetic levitation for high-speed transport |
| Particle accelerators | Large magnetic fields to accelerate particles |
| Fusion reactors | Strong magnetic confinement |
| Electromagnets | Powerful magnetic fields |
| Power cables | Reduced energy dissipation in transmission |
| Microchips | High-performance electronics |

**Maglev trains:**
- Use extremely strong electromagnets to levitate the train
- Can reach speeds up to 603 km/h
- Currently exist in Japan, South Korea, and China

**Exam tip:** Superconductivity means **no** resistance — avoid saying 'little' resistance or 'thermal' conductivity.

## Required Practical: Investigating Resistivity

### Aim

Determine the resistivity of a 2 metre constantan wire.

### Variables

| Type | Variable |
|------|----------|
| **Independent** | Length $L$ of the wire (m) |
| **Dependent** | Current $I$ through the wire (A) |
| **Control** | Voltage through the wire; material of wire |

### Equipment

| Equipment | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Ammeter | Measure current through wire |
| Voltmeter | Measure voltage across wire |
| 2.0 m constantan wire (22–36 swg) | Test material |
| Flying lead | Connect at any point along wire |
| Metre ruler | Measure length of wire |
| Micrometer | Measure diameter of wire |
| Power supply | Provide voltage (6.0 V) |

**Resolution:**
- Metre ruler: 1 mm
- Micrometer screw gauge: 0.01 mm
- Voltmeter: 0.1 V
- Ammeter: 0.01 A

### Method

1. Measure the diameter of the wire using a micrometer at **5–10 random points** along the wire; calculate the **mean diameter**
2. Set up circuit with wire taped/clamped to ruler, one end at the 0 mark; ammeter in **series**, voltmeter in **parallel** to the wire
3. Attach flying lead to test wire at 0.25 m
4. Set power supply to 6.0 V; verify with voltmeter
5. Read and record current from ammeter; **switch off immediately** after reading to prevent heating
6. Vary distance in 0.25 m intervals (0.25, 0.50, 0.75... up to 2.0 m) — aim for **8–10 readings**
7. Record current for each length **at least 3 times**; calculate average current $I$
8. Calculate average resistance for each length: $R = \frac{V}{I}$

### Analysis

From the resistivity equation:

$$R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$$

Comparing to $y = mx$:
- $y = R$
- $x = L$
- Gradient $= \frac{\rho}{A}$

**To find resistivity:**
1. Plot graph of **length $L$** (x-axis) against **resistance $R$** (y-axis)
2. Draw line of best fit
3. Calculate gradient: $\text{gradient} = \frac{\Delta R}{\Delta L} = \frac{\rho}{A}$
4. Calculate cross-sectional area: $A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}$
5. Calculate resistivity: $\rho = \text{gradient} \times A$

### Evaluating the Experiment

**Systematic Errors:**
- Ensure wire starts at 0 on the ruler to avoid **zero error**

**Random Errors:**
- Use **small currents** to prevent temperature increase affecting resistivity
- **Switch off current** between readings to keep temperature constant
- Take **5–10 diameter measurements** with micrometer and calculate mean

### Safety Considerations

- Wire becomes very hot with high current — **never touch** when circuit is on
- Switch off power supply immediately if you smell burning
- Keep liquids away from electrical equipment

## Exam Tips

- Resistivity values will be given in exam questions — no need to memorise
- For circular cross-sections: if diameter doubles, area quadruples, resistance drops to ¼
- Superconductivity = **zero** resistance, not 'low' resistance
- In thermistor circuits, remember NTC thermistors have **inverse** temperature-resistance relationship compared to metals
