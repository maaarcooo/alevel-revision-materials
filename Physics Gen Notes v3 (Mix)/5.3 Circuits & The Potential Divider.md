# 5.3 Circuits & The Potential Divider

## Resistors in Series

When two or more components are connected in series, **the combined resistance is equal to the sum of individual resistances**.

$$R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ...$$

The total resistance in series is always **greater** than any individual resistor.

---

## Resistors in Parallel

When two or more components are connected in parallel, **the reciprocal of the combined resistance is the sum of the reciprocals of individual resistances**.

$$\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + ...$$

Key points:
- As more resistors are added in parallel, combined resistance **decreases**
- Combined resistance is always **less than** the smallest individual resistor
- Two equal resistors in parallel have a combined resistance of **half** the individual value

**Reciprocal tip**: The reciprocal of a value is $\frac{1}{\text{value}}$. To find $R_T$ from $\frac{1}{R_T}$, calculate $1 \div \text{your answer}$ or use the $x^{-1}$ button on your calculator.

## Series & Parallel Circuits Summary

| Property | Series | Parallel |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Voltage** | $V_{in} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3$ | $V_{in} = V_1 = V_2 = V_3$ |
| **Current** | $I_{in} = I_1 = I_2 = I_3$ | $I_{in} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3$ |
| **Resistance** | $R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3$ | $\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}$ |

### Current
- **Series**: Current is the **same** through all components
- **Parallel**: Current **splits** at junctions; amount in each branch depends on the total resistance of that branch

### Potential Difference
- **Series**: The e.m.f. is **shared** amongst components in different amounts depending on their resistance
- **Parallel**: The voltage across all components in each branch **equals the e.m.f.** of the power supply

### Cells in Series and Parallel
- **Cells in series**: Total voltage = sum of individual cell voltages
- **Cells in parallel**: Total voltage = voltage of one cell (but increased current capacity)

## Conservation Laws (Kirchhoff's Laws)

### Kirchhoff's First Law (Conservation of Charge)

**The sum of the currents entering a junction always equals the sum of the currents out of the junction.**

$$I = I_1 + I_2 + I_3$$

- Charge is **never used up or lost** in a circuit
- A **junction** is a point where at least three circuit paths meet
- A **branch** is a path connecting two junctions

### Kirchhoff's Second Law (Conservation of Energy)

**The total e.m.f. in a closed circuit equals the sum of the potential differences across each component.**

$$E_1 + E_2 = V_1 + V_2$$

- Energy is **never used up or lost** in a circuit
- Each closed-circuit loop acts as its own independent series circuit
- In parallel circuits, the sum of voltages in **each closed loop** equals the total e.m.f.

**Application**: Parallel circuits are useful for home wiring systems because:
- A single power source supplies all devices with the same voltage
- If one device fails, others continue to operate

## Electrical Energy & Power

**Power** is defined as the **rate of doing work** (or rate of energy transfer).

$$P = \frac{E}{t} = \frac{W}{t}$$

Where:
- $P$ = power (W)
- $E$ or $W$ = energy or work done (J)
- $t$ = time (s)

### Power Equations

$$P = IV$$

Using Ohm's Law ($V = IR$), power can also be written as:

$$P = I^2R \qquad \text{and} \qquad P = \frac{V^2}{R}$$

**Key relationship**: If current or voltage **doubles**, power increases by a factor of **four** (due to the squared term).

### Energy Transferred

$$E = VIt$$

Where:
- $E$ = energy transferred (J)
- $V$ = voltage (V)
- $I$ = current (A)
- $t$ = time (s)

**Mnemonic**: "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Power equals I squared R"

## Potential Divider Circuits

**Potential dividers** are circuits which produce an **output voltage as a fraction of its input voltage**.

### Three Main Purposes
1. To provide a **variable potential difference**
2. To enable a **specific potential difference** to be chosen
3. To **split the potential difference** of a power source between two or more components

### Potential Divider Equation

$$V_{out} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \times V_{in}$$

Or equivalently:

$$V_{out} = \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} \times V_{in}$$

Where:
- The **numerator** must be the resistance of the resistor across which $V_{out}$ is measured
- $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the two resistors in series
- $V_{in}$ is the input (supply) voltage
- $V_{out}$ is the output voltage

### Key Principles
- The p.d. across a component is **proportional to its resistance** (from $V = IR$)
- The resistor with the **largest resistance** has the **greater potential difference**
- If one resistor's resistance increases, it gets a **greater share** of the p.d., while the other gets a **smaller share**

## Variable Resistance in Potential Dividers

Variable and sensory resistors can be used to **vary the output voltage** in potential divider circuits.

### Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
- **Higher light intensity** → **lower resistance**
- **Lower light intensity** → **higher resistance**
- **Applications**: Street lights, security lights

### Thermistor (NTC type)
- **Higher temperature** → **lower resistance**
- **Lower temperature** → **higher resistance**
- **Applications**: Fire alarms, ovens, digital thermometers

### Effect on Output Voltage
From $V = IR$:
- If LDR/thermistor resistance **decreases** → p.d. across it **decreases** → p.d. across fixed resistor **increases**
- If LDR/thermistor resistance **increases** → p.d. across it **increases** → p.d. across fixed resistor **decreases**

The total p.d. must always equal $V_{in}$ (Kirchhoff's Second Law).

## Common Exam Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Parallel resistance**: Forgetting to find the reciprocal — calculating $\frac{1}{R_T}$ instead of $R_T$
2. Thinking current is the same in every branch of a parallel circuit
3. Thinking voltage is the same across all components in a series circuit
4. Not using the correct resistance in the numerator of the potential divider equation
5. Sum of voltages in series not equalling the supply e.m.f.
6. Current into a junction not equalling current out (violating Kirchhoff's First Law)
7. Forgetting to convert time to **seconds** when calculating power

**Tip**: Annotate circuit diagrams with known values to help identify missing quantities.
