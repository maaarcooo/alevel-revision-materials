# 5.4 Electromotive Force & Internal Resistance

## Electromotive Force (e.m.f)

**Electromotive force (e.m.f)** is the amount of chemical energy converted to electrical energy per coulomb of charge when passing through a power supply.

$$\varepsilon = \frac{E}{Q}$$

Where:
- $\varepsilon$ = e.m.f (V)
- $E$ = energy transferred (J)
- $Q$ = charge (C)

Key points:
- Symbol: $\varepsilon$ (Greek letter epsilon)
- Measured in **volts (V)**
- Despite its name, e.m.f is **not a force**
- E.m.f equals the potential difference across the cell **when no current is flowing**
- Measured using a **high-resistance voltmeter** connected in parallel with the cell in an **open circuit**
- E.m.f is the **total** or **maximum** voltage available to the circuit

## Terminal Potential Difference

**Terminal potential difference (p.d)** is the potential difference across the terminals of a cell.

$$V = IR$$

Where:
- $V$ = terminal p.d (V)
- $I$ = current (A)
- $R$ = resistance of external circuit (Ω)

The terminal p.d is always **lower** than the e.m.f because of internal resistance.

## Lost Volts

**Lost volts** ($v$) is the work done per unit charge to overcome the internal resistance inside the battery when current flows.

$$v = \varepsilon - V = Ir$$

Where:
- $v$ = lost volts (V)
- $\varepsilon$ = e.m.f (V)
- $V$ = terminal p.d (V)
- $I$ = current (A)
- $r$ = internal resistance (Ω)

Lost volts represents the voltage lost in the cell due to internal resistance.

## Internal Resistance

**Internal resistance** ($r$) is the resistance of the materials within the battery.

Effects of internal resistance:
- Causes charge to dissipate electrical energy within the power supply
- Makes the cell become **warm** after a period of time
- Causes **loss of voltage** or energy loss in a power supply over time

A cell can be modelled as an e.m.f source with an internal resistance connected **in series**.

## E.m.f Equation

The fundamental equation relating e.m.f to terminal p.d and lost volts:

$$\varepsilon = IR + Ir = I(R + r)$$

Where:
- $\varepsilon$ = e.m.f (V)
- $I$ = current (A)
- $R$ = resistance of external load (Ω)
- $r$ = internal resistance (Ω)
- $IR$ = terminal p.d (V)
- $Ir$ = lost volts (V)

Rearranging for current:

$$I = \frac{\varepsilon}{R + r}$$

## Key Equations Summary

| Quantity | Equation | Units |
|----------|----------|-------|
| E.m.f | $\varepsilon = \frac{E}{Q}$ | V |
| E.m.f | $\varepsilon = I(R + r)$ | V |
| Terminal p.d | $V = IR$ | V |
| Lost volts | $v = Ir$ | V |
| Current | $I = \frac{\varepsilon}{R + r}$ | A |

## Required Practical: Investigating EMF & Internal Resistance

### Aim
Investigate the relationship between e.m.f and internal resistance by measuring current and voltage using a variable resistor.

### Variables
- **Independent variable**: Resistance, $R$ (Ω)
- **Dependent variables**: Voltage, $V$ (V) and Current, $I$ (A)
- **Control variables**: E.m.f of the cell, internal resistance of the cell

### Equipment
| Apparatus | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| 1.5 V Cell | Provide e.m.f to the circuit |
| Resistor | Act as internal resistance |
| 100Ω Variable Resistor | Change current and voltage values |
| Voltmeter (0–2 V) | Measure voltage |
| Ammeter (0–200 mA) | Measure current |
| Wires | Make electrical connections |
| Switch | Open between readings to prevent battery drain |

Resolution: Voltmeter = 1 mV, Ammeter = 0.1 mA

### Method
1. Connect the cell and resistor $r$ in series (treat as a single cell)
2. With switch **open**, record the voltmeter reading $V$
3. Set variable resistor to **maximum** value, close switch, record $V$ and $I$
4. **Open switch between readings** to prevent battery drain
5. Vary resistance across the full range, taking **8–10 readings** of $V$ and $I$

### Analysis

Rearranging the e.m.f equation for $V$:

$$V = -rI + \varepsilon$$

Comparing to $y = mx + c$:
- $y = V$ (V)
- $x = I$ (A)
- **Gradient** = $-r$ (Ω)
- **Y-intercept** = $\varepsilon$ (V)

Plot a graph of **V against I**:
- Draw a line of best fit
- The **y-intercept** gives the e.m.f
- The **gradient** (negative) gives the internal resistance

### Evaluating the Experiment

**Systematic Errors:**
- Only close the switch **briefly** to take each reading
- This prevents the internal resistance from changing during the experiment

**Random Errors:**
- Use **fairly new cells** — run-down batteries have variable e.m.f and internal resistance
- Wait for readings to **stabilise** before recording
- Take **at least 3 repeat readings** and calculate a mean

**Safety Considerations:**
- Electrical components can get **hot** with prolonged use
- Switch off immediately if you smell burning
- Keep liquids away from electrical equipment

## Exam Tips

- If a question states "battery of **negligible internal resistance**", e.m.f equals terminal p.d — no internal resistance calculations needed
- If the circuit diagram shows internal resistance, you must use the e.m.f equations
- When calculating current in a circuit with internal resistance, use $I = \frac{\varepsilon}{R + r}$, not $I = \frac{V}{R}$
- Remember the gradient of the V–I graph is **negative** internal resistance
